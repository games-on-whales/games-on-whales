We (try to) follow a functional programming paradigm where all the methods take immutable inputs and returns new outputs; this has great benefits: Given the highly parallel nature of Wolf, we can easily share immutable data structures to multiple threads without having to deal with race conditions. This gives us the power to support multiple concurrent users effortlessly. Code can easily be re-used by other projects since every part is highly decoupled. Enables testing most of the implemented methods in isolation. We are also trying to isolate the Moonlight protocol from the actual implementation so that we can create a portable C++ library of stateless methods, where possible, the code has been separated in logical modules. High-level utilities and re-usable libraries, not strictly tied to Moonlight or Wolf: docker.hpp: using libcurl and boost json to interrogate the Docker socket and provide an easy to use interface to most methods. input.hpp: an easy to use virtual input device library; supports mouse, keyboard, joypads and more! virtual-display.hpp: a simple abstraction on top of games-on-whales/gst-wayland-display in order to create and control virtual desktops. audio.hpp: virtual audio library A little CLI tool that enables us to generate udev events. You can read more about the rationale behind it in Hotplug in Docker. Here we define core Moonlight functions in order to create the foundation for a platform-agnostic portable library. It currently hosts the followings: HTTP/S protocol interface: protocol.hpp Control protocol packet format control.hpp Reed Solomon FEC header fec.hpp Based on top of sleepybishop/nanors RTSP message parser parser.hpp Built using yhirose/cpp-peglib by writing a formal PEG (Parsing Expression Grammars) definition for all messages This is where the final Wolf executable will be built, contains all the additional code and logic required to run the full Moonlight server. Unit tests will live under tests/ and are written using the Catch2 framework. We are implementing unit tests for most of the methods and (where possible) also mocking packets/requests seen during real Moonlight sessions.

A working example: connecting a joypad to the client triggers the right detection in RetroArch running in the server. Wolf creates virtual devices on-demand based on the packets that are received from Moonlight clients over the control stream. When a new virtual device is created, we have to \"mount\" it inside the right running Docker container since, in order to achieve isolation, we can’t run them with the privileged flag. Normally, Docker assigns devices available to a container at creation time. Fortunately, it supports a more permissive rule that allows to access a wider range of devices based on the device major:minor. By adding the --device-cgroup-rule we can then call mknod [1] from inside the container in order to mount the virtual devices on-demand from the outside. Example Docker command issued by Wolf docker exec -it sh -c \"mknod /dev/input/ c :\" We’ve mounted the right device into the right container, still, no application is picking it up [2]. We have to trigger some kind of \"event\" in order to advertise that a new device has arrived, turns out those kind of events are generated by udev. An example udev event when you plug a joypad UDEV [3588.199301] add /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.3/0000:02:00.0/usb1/1-1/1-1:1.3/0003:054C:0CE6.0007/input/input20/js0 (input) ACTION=add SUBSYSTEM=input DEVNAME=/dev/input/js0 ID_BUS=usb ID_MODEL=Wireless_Controller ID_SERIAL=Sony_Interactive_Entertainment_Wireless_Controller ID_VENDOR=Sony_Interactive_Entertainment ID_VENDOR_ENC=Sony\\x20Interactive\\x20Entertainment ID_VENDOR_ID=054c ID_REVISION=0100 ID_TYPE=hid ID_USB_VENDOR_ID=054c ID_USB_REVISION=0100 ID_USB_TYPE=hid ID_USB_DRIVER=usbhid MAJOR=13 MINOR=0 The first approach is to just pass the udev socket (and db files, more on this later) from the host. Sure, every application will get the event that a new device has been plugged, so this kind of defeats isolation; but since we are mounting only in one container, this should still work, right? Unfortunately, there’s another issue: when Wolf creates a new virtual device, it will in turn automatically trigger the udev event to be \"broadcast\" to every listening application and if this happens before we are able to mknod the device it’ll result in an application that can’t access the device that we’ve created. We want to be able to be in control of exactly when these events will be sent so that the flow is as follows: Figure 2. The order here matters, the udev events must be sent after the mount Since we have no control over udev and we can’t mount a device before it’s created we have to replicate the events that are generated by it and broadcast them in the same way to all listening applications. First, let’s take a step back; how are application communicating with udev? Though udev runs in userspace, it is highly entangled with the Linux kernel. The first entry that recognizes device insertion/deletion events is surely the Linux kernel. While there were no mechanisms for the Linux kernel to push notifications to userspace processes (with ioctl() the kernel can only provide responses for the corresponding requests from userspace processes), netlink IPC mechanism emerged and currently it is available for the kernel to send a notification first. — https://insujang.github.io/2018-11-27/udev-device-manager-for-the-linux-kernel-in-userspace/ Normally udevd does the following steps: Listens for kernel events via the netlink socket (GROUP_KERNEL) When it receives a new device event, it’ll run all the rules that are defined Send back the \"augmented\" message via another netlink socket (GROUP_UDEV) The two different groups are crucial, whilst every user application can listen the GROUP_KERNEL events only the kernel can be the origin for those messages. GROUP_UDEV being an user space group instead can be \"impersonated\" by any user space application [3]. Since this will run in Docker there’s an additional mechanism that we have to keep in mind: network namespaces. Since udevd communicates via netlink a container that doesn’t run with --network=host will not receive those events; we’ll have to run our custom udev sender inside the container network namespace in order to achieve full isolation. There are 3 main components that needs to be \"faked\" in order for tricking programs that are using libudev into using our fake events: create a file under /run/udev/control this is not used for anything else apart from detection that udev is present AFAIU. send a valid NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT event via netlink using GROUP_UDEV generate the appropriate DB entries in /run/udev/data/ these are just plain text files where the filename is just c: and the content is roughly the same as the event message payload The result of all this is our little CLI utility called fake-udev which we’ll install into our containers and call with our custom-generated events after mknod. echo -ne \\\"ACTION=add\\\\0DEVNAME=input/bomb\\\\0DEVPATH=/devices/bomb\\\\0SEQNUM=1234\\\\0SUBSYSTEM=input\\\\0\\\" | base64 | sudo fake-udev # `udevadm monitor` should print something like: UDEV [3931.403835] add /devices/bomb (input) These steps will finally achieve proper hotplug detection by the applications that are running inside a Docker container without exposing any udev event/file from the host filesystem. Luckily, reversing the steps is enough to also correctly unplug devices. First off, a huge thanks goes to John McDonough for all the help in figuring most of this stuff out and for leading the way with his prototype JohnCMcDonough/virtual-gamepad. 1. This obviously requires also the MKNOD capability to be enabled (--cap-add MKNOD) 2. Some application might react to the new device if it’s using inotify, unfortunately, this is not the default behaviour in most apps/games 3.

The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing. — gstreamer.freedesktop.org We implemented two custom plugins (one for video and one for audio) in order to turn a stream of bytes into a stream of valid Moonlight RTP packets. This allows users to be able to compose Gstreamer pipelines in any form or shape and, near the end, plug our plugin so that it can be streamed to Moonlight. Figure 1. Our plugin sits between the encoded bitestream and a downstream UDP sink that will send the RTP packets to Moonlight The basic flow is the following: The plugin receives a GstBuffer of binary data: the encoded video or audio stream into a format that can be decoded back by the Moonlight client. We’ll split this into a GstBufferList of valid RTP packets following the Moonlight specifications; this includes: split the original buffer into a set of correctly sized chunks Encrypt the chunks when enabled add RTP headers to each chunk create additional RTP packets with the FEC information Push the resulting list downstream Figure 2. An example pipeline for video encoding and streaming Figure 3. An example pipeline for audio encoding and streaming This flow is general enough to enable us to use the same plugin for H.264, HEVC and AV1 (and any other encoder that will be supported in future). Downstream, it’s also trivial to switch between UDP/TCP or even a complete different delivery method if needed. We decided to split between audio and video because they have different RTP packet structure, non overlapping properties, different FEC encoding and different encryption requirements but the basic flow is the same for both plugins. Given that this is a direct transformation from one input buffer to another output buffer we decided to use GstBaseTransform as the base class. This will implement some boilerplate code for us so that we can focus on the main _transform virtual method implementation. Following the nomenclature used in the official GStreamer RTP plugins we called them rtpmoonlightpay_video and rtpmoonlightpay_audio as in RTP Moonlight Payloader video/audio. GStreamer uses GObjects: a mechanism to retrofit Objects into C. I suggest you to get a bit familiar with it before diving into the code; here’s a great and simple tutorial. Following the official docs at Plugin Write’s Guide we started off with the official bash script that creates the boilerplate code from the selected base class; namely: gstrtpmoonlightpay_video.hpp and gstrtpmoonlightpay_video.cpp contain all the boilerplate code needed to setup a plugin, property definitions, etc. gstrtpmoonlightpay_audio.hpp and gstrtpmoonlightpay_audio.cpp for audio. video.hpp contains all the functions that turns a linear buffer of data into a list of correctly formed RTP packets. audio.hpp same for audio","title":"GStreamer","component":"wolf","version":"dev-nix","name":"gstreamer","url":"/wolf/dev-nix/dev/gstreamer.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"The plugin","hash":"_the_plugin","id":2},{"text":"Code","hash":"_code","id":3}]},"5":{"id":5,"text":"This has been tested on Debian 12, you should adjust the setup based on your distro of choice.

You can just use ximagesrc and hook your host X11 desktop to the stream but there are some issues with that: Xorg has to be up and running; we can run it via Docker in GOW but that’s not without its challenges. You need a physical monitor or a dummy plugged into your GPU (or some esoteric EDID trick which works only when also performing a human sacrifice). It doesn’t scale well with multiple remote clients when sharing a single host Ideally, can’t we just plug the shared video memory from the running App straight into Gstreamer ?? In theory, for a single fullscreen application that’s kind of possible (read until the end to get an idea of why it’s not so simple); but we need some way to compose multiple running windows into a single scene to be then encoded via the Gstreamer pipeline. Turns out that’s exactly what a Compositing window manager (or compositor) does, and since you can’t have just a compositor without the full X Window System (X11) running, we decided to follow the Wayland route. We are in a very fortunate position: we don’t even want to deal with real monitors, we just want to be the glue between an application running and the Gstreamer pipeline; for this reason we can have a simplified view (and implementation). Figure 1. A high level overview of the main components Let’s dive into each of these parts in isolation. The Wayland protocol does not include a rendering API. Instead, Wayland follows a direct rendering model, in which the client must render the window contents to a buffer shareable with the compositor. — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(protocol)#Rendering_model By removing the X server from the picture we also removed the mechanism by which X clients typically render, but there’s another mechanism: direct rendering. With direct rendering, the client and the server share a video memory buffer. The client links to a rendering library such as OpenGL that knows how to program the hardware and renders directly into the buffer. The compositor in turn can take the buffer and use it as a texture when it composites the desktop. One simple way to implement this buffer would be to use shm as a simple shared region between clients and the server. Most Wayland compositors do their rendering on the GPU, and many Wayland clients do their rendering on the GPU as well. With the shared memory approach, sending buffers from the client to the compositor in such cases is very inefficient, as the client has to read their data from the GPU to the CPU, then the compositor has to read it from the CPU back to the GPU to be rendered. The Linux DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) interface provides a means for us to export handles to GPU resources. Mesa, the predominant implementation of userspace Linux graphics drivers, implements a protocol that allows EGL users to transfer handles to their GPU buffers from the client to the compositor for rendering, without ever copying data to the GPU. Wayland is designed to update everything atomically, such that no frame is ever presented in an invalid or intermediate state. Our custom Wayland compositor knows where to get the rendered buffers, but it doesn’t know when the buffer is ready to be rendered; here’s where the Wayland protocol comes into play. Client surfaces will start in a pending state (and no state at all when first created), this state is negotiated over the course of any number of requests from clients and events from the server; when both sides agree that it’s a consistent surface, the surface is committed. Until this time, the compositor will continue to render the last consistent state. In Wayland, instead of continuously pushing new frames, you can let the compositor tell you when it’s ready for a new frame using frame callbacks. The compositor must finally compose the various surfaces into a single image, in order to do that efficiently we’ll also use EGL. Figure 2. The compositor communicates with the apps via the Wayland protocol, and compose surfaces via EGL Our compositor finally composed an image, and we are ready to send this to our Moonlight client, how do we push this to the selected encoder in the Gstreamer pipeline without copying? Sad news is, we don’t (at least currently). Although Gstreamer supports DMA Buffers (Direct Memory Access) which are an efficient way to share memory without going through the CPU, the support for modifiers of DMA Buffers is lacking behind significantly and varyies from one plugin to the next. What are modifiers? Modifiers add additional vendor specific properties to the internal pixel layout of a buffer. These modifiers are usually internally used by the GPU to speed up certain operations depending on characteristics of the hardware. None of this really has to worry us, because all of that is handled by the gpu driver. But because DMA buffers exist outside of the scope of a singular device, we need to carry the modifier of the buffer along. If it gets lost on the way, the program receiving the buffer has no idea how the data is layed out in memory and will likely output a broken image. Modifiers as such a crucial for communicating formats across devices, but they haven’t existed all the time. So called \"explicit\" modifiers are a relatively new addition to the apis in question. Previously the drivers managed modifiers internally without exposing them to the user. Buffers without an accompanying modifier are as such described as having an \"implicit\" modifier. Because the modifier is handled internally by the driver communication across devices is impossible with such a buffer. Because these changes are relatively new, a lot of software still has to adapt to the new explicit apis and many try to be able to handle both, implicit and explicit buffers. Gstreamer being composed of many plugins currently results in very different stages of transitioning between these apis. Some apis even got support for explicit modifiers, only to drop it a release later, because users of older plugins were complaining about incompatibilities…​ This means the chance of getting a good image out of the pipeline starting with a DMA Buffer is very small. Given the state of things, we are currently copying the buffer through host-memory once to side-step this issue for now. The plan for the future is to provide first an experimental option for using DMA buffers, and later with more testing and development we will hopefully be able to share, compose and finally encode different buffer types with zero memory copied between the GPU and the CPU for truely the best possible latency.

The port exchanged during the RTSP phase it’s not where the actual video stream will take place! Moonlight will send a PING package to the exchanged port, this will tell us which random port the connecting client was able to open in order to communicate with Wolf. The client port from where Wolf receives the PING will also be the one where the actual RTP stream will be sent to. This is necessary because usually clients will be behind NAT. The video binary NAL unit (see below) will be separated in chunks of packetSize (default: 1024, exchanged during RTSP) + RTP_HEADER_SIZE (16 byte). The first 32 bytes of each packet are defined as follows: Figure 1. RTP header format in bits Figure 2. NV Video header format in bits The very first packet of the sequence will also contain the hardcoded 017charss string before the actual video payload What does this content mean? Figure 3. Video payload starts after the 8 hardcoded bytes 017charss (hex: 0137636861727373) Content value (decimal) value (binary) Contains Picture data 1 00000001 EOF (End of File) 2 00000010 SOF (Start of File) 4 00000100 They’ll be summed together, for example: 5 means Picture data AND Start of File. Uses Reed Solomon to encode the payload so that it can be checked on the receiving end for transmission errors (and possibly fix them). This operation will create extra parity blocks that will be sent in separate RTP packets. The size of this can be set by changing the fecpercentage param. With a video payload of 4KB, a packetSize of 1024 and a fecpercentage of 50%: 4 RTP packets will contain the video data 2 extra RTP packets will be sent with the FEC parity information The total overhead of sending 4KB of video will be: headers * packets + FEC = 32 * 6 + 2048 = 2248 bytes This extra packets can be easily identified since the NV Video flag will always be 0.

RTSP messages are plaintext packets of variable size over TCP. Parsing of RTSP messages has been implemented using a formal PEG (Parsing Expression Grammars) definition; you can find it in parser.hpp. There are two types of message: request and response All messages have the following structure: message: required options: optional, zero or more key value options separated by newline payload: optional, extra unstructured data that needs to be passed. An example request message OPTIONS rtsp://192.168.1.100:48010 RTSP/1.0 (1) CSeq: 1 (2) X-GS-ClientVersion: 14 (3) (4) a=fmtp:97 surround-params=21101 (5) 1 message: 2 option 1 3 option 2 4 empty new line (end of options) 5 payload The message part is the first line, it’s delimited by the newline character (\\r\\n) , and it’s composed by: command: the first string, delimited by , the command to be executed on the backend; one of: [OPTIONS, DESCRIBE, SETUP, ANNOUNCE, PLAY] target: the second string, delimited by , specifies the ip address and port that is the target of the session. protocol: last string, delimited by , the RTSP protocol in use. Optional additional key values to be passed, delimited by the newline character (\\r\\n). The end of the options section is marked by an extra newline character (\\r\\n). Honorable mention goes to CSeq which is always present and represent the sequence number. Any extra unstructured text that it’s added after the end of the options before the end of the message will be parsed as the payload. Like requests, responses have a message, zero or more options and an optional payload. The main difference is in the format of the message. You can easily identify a response package by looking at the command part which is always RTSP. An example response message RTSP/1.0 200 OK (1) CSeq: 1 (2) a=fmtp:97 surround-params=21101 (3) 1 message 2 option 3 payload Unlike requests a message in a response is composed by different parts: protocol: it’s always RTSP/* and it’s the easiest way to discriminate between request and response messages. status code: follows the HTTP status codes specification status string: follows the HTTP status codes specification","title":"RTSP","component":"wolf","version":"dev-nix","name":"rtsp","url":"/wolf/dev-nix/protocols/rtsp.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"RTSP specifications","hash":"_rtsp_specifications","id":2},{"text":"Request message","hash":"_request_message","id":3},{"text":"Message","hash":"_message","id":4},{"text":"Options","hash":"_options","id":5},{"text":"Payload","hash":"_payload","id":6},{"text":"Response message","hash":"_response_message","id":7},{"text":"Message","hash":"_message_2","id":8}]},"14":{"id":14,"text":"Wolf is configured via a TOML config file and some additional optional ENV variables Variable Default Description WOLF_LOG_LEVEL INFO The log level to show, one of ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE WOLF_CFG_FILE /wolf/cfg/config.toml Full path to the config file WOLF_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE /wolf/cfg/key.pem Full path to the key.pem file WOLF_PRIVATE_CERT_FILE /wolf/cfg/cert.pem Full path to the cert.pem file XDG_RUNTIME_DIR /tmp/sockets The full path where PulseAudio and video sockets will reside, this path is expected to be present in the host and mounted in the Wolf container WOLF_PULSE_IMAGE ghcr.io/games-on-whales/pulseaudio:master The name of the PulseAudio image to be started (when no connection is available) WOLF_STOP_CONTAINER_ON_EXIT TRUE Set to False in order to avoid force stop and removal of containers when the connection is closed WOLF_DOCKER_SOCKET /var/run/docker.sock The full path to the docker socket, doesn’t support tcp (yet) NVIDIA_DRIVER_VOLUME_NAME nvidia-driver-vol The name of the externally created Docker Volume that holds the Nvidia drivers HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER /etc/wolf The base folder in the host where the running apps will store permanent state WOLF_RENDER_NODE /dev/dri/renderD128 The default render node used for virtual desktops; see: Multiple GPUs WOLF_DOCKER_FAKE_UDEV_PATH $HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER/fake-udev The path on the host for the fake-udev CLI tool Additional env variables useful when debugging: Variable Default Description RUST_BACKTRACE full In case an exception is thrown in the Rust code, this sets the backtrace level GST_DEBUG 2 Gstreamer debug print, see debugging-tools The TOML configuration file is read only once at startup (or created if not present) and it’ll be modified by Wolf only when a new user is successfully paired.

In order to automatically pick up the right encoder at runtime based on the user HW we run in order the list of encoders at gstreamer.video.hevc_encoders (and gstreamer.video.h264_encoders); the first set of plugins that can be correctly initialised by Gstreamer will be the selected encoder for all the pipelines. You can read more about gstreamer and custom pipelines in the Gstreamer page. When you have multiple GPUs installed in your host, you might want to have better control over which one is used by Wolf and how. There are two main separated parts that make use of HW acceleration in Wolf: Gstreamer video encoding: this will use HW acceleration in order to efficiently encode the video stream with H.264 or HEVC. App render node: this will use HW acceleration in order to create virtual Wayland desktops and run the chosen app (ex: Firefox, Steam, …​) They can be configured separately, and ideally you could even use two GPUs at the same time for different jobs; a common setup would be to use the integrated GPU just for the streaming part and use a powerful GPU to play apps/games. The streaming video encoding pipeline is fully controlled by the config.toml file; here the order in which entries are listed is important because Wolf will just try each listed plugin; the first one that works is the one that will be used. If you have an Intel iGPU and a Nvidia card in the same host, and you would like to use QuickSync in order to do the encoding, you can either: Delete the nvcodec entries under gstreamer.video.hevc_encoders Cut the qsv entry and paste it above the nvcodec entry On top of that, each single apps entry support overriding the default streaming pipeline; for example: [[apps]] title = \"Test ball\" # More options here, removed for brevity... [apps.video] source = \"\"\" videotestsrc pattern=ball flip=true is-live=true ! video/x-raw, framerate={fps}/1 \\ \"\"\" In case you have two GPUs that will use the same encoder pipeline (example: an AMD iGPU and an AMD GPU card) you can override the encoder_pipeline with the corresponding encoder plugin; see: gstreamer/issues/1167. Each application that Wolf will start will have access only to a specific render node even if the host has multiple GPUs connected. By default, Wolf will use the env variable WOLF_RENDER_NODE which defaults to /dev/dri/renderD128 If you don’t know which render node is associated with which GPU you can use the following command: ls -l /sys/class/drm/renderD*/device/driver /sys/class/drm/renderD128/device/driver -> ../../../../bus/virtio/drivers/virtio_gpu (1) /sys/class/drm/renderD129/device/driver -> ../../../../bus/pci/drivers/nvidia (2) 1 This line will tell you that renderD128 is a virtual GPU 2 This line will tell you that renderD129 is a Nvidia GPU Wolf supports also overriding the render node in each single app defined in the config.toml config file by setting the render_node property; example: [apps.runner] type = \"docker\" name = \"WolfSteam\" image = \"ghcr.io/games-on-whales/steam:edge\" # More options here, removed for brevity... render_node = \"/dev/dri/renderD129\"","title":"Configuration","component":"wolf","version":"dev-nix","name":"configuration","url":"/wolf/dev-nix/user/configuration.html","titles":[{"text":"ENV variables","hash":"_env_variables","id":1},{"text":"TOML file","hash":"_toml_file","id":2},{"text":"Defining apps","hash":"_defining_apps","id":3},{"text":"App Runner","hash":"_app_runner","id":4},{"text":"Process","hash":"_process","id":5},{"text":"Docker","hash":"_docker","id":6},{"text":"Gstreamer","hash":"_gstreamer","id":7},{"text":"Multiple GPUs","hash":"_multiple_gpu","id":8},{"text":"Gstreamer video encoding","hash":"_gstreamer_video_encoding","id":9},{"text":"App render node","hash":"_app_render_node","id":10}]},"15":{"id":15,"text":"To list the installed plugins use: gst-inspect-1.0 To analyse some media use: gst-discoverer-1.0 -v https://storage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4 To test out pipelines in your system use: gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! autovideosink See more examples at: matthew1000/gstreamer-cheat-sheet [[apps]] title = \"Desktop\" [apps.video] source = \"avfvideosrc capture-screen-cursor=true capture-screen=true\" This works in OSX, for X11 you can use ximagesrc or on Wayland you can try: pipewiresrc Here the trick is to use shmsink and shmsrc in order to share the raw audio between the video and audio pipeline: [[apps]] title = \"Music\" # Audio sample downloaded from https://www.bensound.com/free-music-for-videos # try also: spacescope style=color-lines [apps.video] source = \"\"\" filesrc location=/Users/ale/Downloads/elevate.mp3 ! tee name=t ! queue ! shmsink socket-path=/tmp/pipe.sock shm-size=10000000 t. ! decodebin ! audioconvert ! wavescope style=color-lines \"\"\" # Get the audio info using: # gst-discoverer-1.0 -v elevate.mp3 [apps.audio] source = \"\"\" shmsrc socket-path=/tmp/pipe.sock do-timestamp=true ! audio/mpeg, mpegversion=(int)1, mpegaudioversion=(int)1, layer=(int)3, rate=(int)44100, channels=(int)2 ! decodebin \"\"\" Here the trick is to use shmsink and shmsrc in order to share the raw audio between the video and audio pipeline: [[apps]] title = \"BigBuckBunny (MP4 - remote)\" [apps.video] # taken from https://gist.github.com/jsturgis/3b19447b304616f18657 source = \"\"\" curlhttpsrc location=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4\" ! qtdemux name=demux demux.audio_0 ! queue ! shmsink socket-path=/tmp/pipe.sock shm-size=10000000 demux.video_0 ! decodebin \\ \"\"\" # Get the audio info using: # gst-discoverer-1.0 -v https://storage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4 [apps.audio] source = \"\"\" shmsrc socket-path=/tmp/pipe.sock do-timestamp=true ! audio/mpeg, mpegversion=(int)4, framed=(boolean)true, stream-format=(string)raw, level=(string)2, base-profile=(string)lc, profile=(string)lc, codec_data=(buffer)1210, rate=(int)44100, channels=(int)2 ! decodebin \"\"\" Here the trick is to use shmsink and shmsrc in order to share the raw audio between the video and audio pipeline: [[apps]] title = \"Twitch.tv\" [apps.video] # location is the result of # youtube-dl --format mp4 --get-url https://www.twitch.tv/videos/560738950 source = \"\"\" curlhttpsrc location=\"https://dqrpb9wgowsf5.cloudfront.net/49e35d90a96078583c9c_andrewfoxtv_34248972186_2596839032/chunked/highlight-560738950.m3u8\" ! hlsdemux ! tsdemux name=demux demux.audio_0_0100 ! queue ! shmsink socket-path=/tmp/pipe.sock shm-size=10000000 demux.video_0_0101 ! queue ! decodebin \\ \"\"\" # Get the audio info using: # gst-discoverer-1.0 -v https://dqrpb9wgowsf5.cloudfront.net/49e35d90a96078583c9c_andrewfoxtv_34248972186_2596839032/chunked/highlight-560738950.m3u8 [apps.audio] source = \"\"\" shmsrc socket-path=/tmp/pipe.sock do-timestamp=true ! audio/mpeg, framed=(boolean)true, mpegversion=(int)4, level=(string)2, base-profile=(string)lc, profile=(string)lc, rate=(int)44100, channels=(int)2, stream-format=(string)adts ! decodebin \"\"\" The element compositor allows video to be mixed (overlayed, put side-by-side, etc).

SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{id/vendor}==\"ab00\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", ENV{ID_SEAT}=\"seat9\" This line checks for the custom vendor-id that Wolf gives to newly created virtual devices and assigns them to seat9, which will cause any session with a lower seat (usually you only have seat1 for your main session) to ignore the devices.

The assigned name instead is specific to Wolf. You can’t assign controllers a seat however (well - you can - but it won’t have the same effect), so we just give it permissions where only user+group can pick it up.

We (try to) follow a functional programming paradigm where all the methods take immutable inputs and returns new outputs; this has great benefits: Given the highly parallel nature of Wolf, we can easily share immutable data structures to multiple threads without having to deal with race conditions. This gives us the power to support multiple concurrent users effortlessly. Code can easily be re-used by other projects since every part is highly decoupled. Enables testing most of the implemented methods in isolation. We are also trying to isolate the Moonlight protocol from the actual implementation so that we can create a portable C++ library of stateless methods, where possible, the code has been separated in logical modules. High-level utilities and re-usable libraries, not strictly tied to Moonlight or Wolf: docker.hpp: using libcurl and boost json to interrogate the Docker socket and provide an easy to use interface to most methods. input.hpp: an easy to use virtual input device library; supports mouse, keyboard, joypads and more! virtual-display.hpp: a simple abstraction on top of games-on-whales/gst-wayland-display in order to create and control virtual desktops. audio.hpp: virtual audio library A little CLI tool that enables us to generate udev events. You can read more about the rationale behind it in Hotplug in Docker. Here we define core Moonlight functions in order to create the foundation for a platform-agnostic portable library. It currently hosts the followings: HTTP/S protocol interface: protocol.hpp Control protocol packet format control.hpp Reed Solomon FEC header fec.hpp Based on top of sleepybishop/nanors RTSP message parser parser.hpp Built using yhirose/cpp-peglib by writing a formal PEG (Parsing Expression Grammars) definition for all messages This is where the final Wolf executable will be built, contains all the additional code and logic required to run the full Moonlight server. Unit tests will live under tests/ and are written using the Catch2 framework. We are implementing unit tests for most of the methods and (where possible) also mocking packets/requests seen during real Moonlight sessions. Some of them are platform/HW specific; they are all enabled by default, you should disable them based on your platform.

A working example: connecting a joypad to the client triggers the right detection in RetroArch running in the server. Wolf creates virtual devices on-demand based on the packets that are received from Moonlight clients over the control stream. When a new virtual device is created, we have to \"mount\" it inside the right running Docker container since, in order to achieve isolation, we can’t run them with the privileged flag. Normally, Docker assigns devices available to a container at creation time. Fortunately, it supports a more permissive rule that allows to access a wider range of devices based on the device major:minor. By adding the --device-cgroup-rule we can then call mknod [1] from inside the container in order to mount the virtual devices on-demand from the outside. Example Docker command issued by Wolf docker exec -it sh -c \"mknod /dev/input/ c :\" We’ve mounted the right device into the right container, still, no application is picking it up [2]. We have to trigger some kind of \"event\" in order to advertise that a new device has arrived, turns out those kind of events are generated by udev. An example udev event when you plug a joypad UDEV [3588.199301] add /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.3/0000:02:00.0/usb1/1-1/1-1:1.3/0003:054C:0CE6.0007/input/input20/js0 (input) ACTION=add SUBSYSTEM=input DEVNAME=/dev/input/js0 ID_BUS=usb ID_MODEL=Wireless_Controller ID_SERIAL=Sony_Interactive_Entertainment_Wireless_Controller ID_VENDOR=Sony_Interactive_Entertainment ID_VENDOR_ENC=Sony\\x20Interactive\\x20Entertainment ID_VENDOR_ID=054c ID_REVISION=0100 ID_TYPE=hid ID_USB_VENDOR_ID=054c ID_USB_REVISION=0100 ID_USB_TYPE=hid ID_USB_DRIVER=usbhid MAJOR=13 MINOR=0 The first approach is to just pass the udev socket (and db files, more on this later) from the host. Sure, every application will get the event that a new device has been plugged, so this kind of defeats isolation; but since we are mounting only in one container, this should still work, right? Unfortunately, there’s another issue: when Wolf creates a new virtual device, it will in turn automatically trigger the udev event to be \"broadcast\" to every listening application and if this happens before we are able to mknod the device it’ll result in an application that can’t access the device that we’ve created. We want to be able to be in control of exactly when these events will be sent so that the flow is as follows: Figure 2. The order here matters, the udev events must be sent after the mount Since we have no control over udev and we can’t mount a device before it’s created we have to replicate the events that are generated by it and broadcast them in the same way to all listening applications. First, let’s take a step back; how are application communicating with udev? Though udev runs in userspace, it is highly entangled with the Linux kernel. The first entry that recognizes device insertion/deletion events is surely the Linux kernel. While there were no mechanisms for the Linux kernel to push notifications to userspace processes (with ioctl() the kernel can only provide responses for the corresponding requests from userspace processes), netlink IPC mechanism emerged and currently it is available for the kernel to send a notification first. — https://insujang.github.io/2018-11-27/udev-device-manager-for-the-linux-kernel-in-userspace/ Normally udevd does the following steps: Listens for kernel events via the netlink socket (GROUP_KERNEL) When it receives a new device event, it’ll run all the rules that are defined Send back the \"augmented\" message via another netlink socket (GROUP_UDEV) The two different groups are crucial, whilst every user application can listen the GROUP_KERNEL events only the kernel can be the origin for those messages. GROUP_UDEV being an user space group instead can be \"impersonated\" by any user space application [3]. Since this will run in Docker there’s an additional mechanism that we have to keep in mind: network namespaces. Since udevd communicates via netlink a container that doesn’t run with --network=host will not receive those events; we’ll have to run our custom udev sender inside the container network namespace in order to achieve full isolation. There are 3 main components that needs to be \"faked\" in order for tricking programs that are using libudev into using our fake events: create a file under /run/udev/control this is not used for anything else apart from detection that udev is present AFAIU. send a valid NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT event via netlink using GROUP_UDEV generate the appropriate DB entries in /run/udev/data/ these are just plain text files where the filename is just c: and the content is roughly the same as the event message payload The result of all this is our little CLI utility called fake-udev which we’ll install into our containers and call with our custom-generated events after mknod. echo -ne \\\"ACTION=add\\\\0DEVNAME=input/bomb\\\\0DEVPATH=/devices/bomb\\\\0SEQNUM=1234\\\\0SUBSYSTEM=input\\\\0\\\" | base64 | sudo fake-udev # `udevadm monitor` should print something like: UDEV [3931.403835] add /devices/bomb (input) These steps will finally achieve proper hotplug detection by the applications that are running inside a Docker container without exposing any udev event/file from the host filesystem. Luckily, reversing the steps is enough to also correctly unplug devices. First off, a huge thanks goes to John McDonough for all the help in figuring most of this stuff out and for leading the way with his prototype JohnCMcDonough/virtual-gamepad. 1. This obviously requires also the MKNOD capability to be enabled (--cap-add MKNOD) 2. Some application might react to the new device if it’s using inotify, unfortunately, this is not the default behaviour in most apps/games 3.

The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing. — gstreamer.freedesktop.org We implemented two custom plugins (one for video and one for audio) in order to turn a stream of bytes into a stream of valid Moonlight RTP packets. This allows users to be able to compose Gstreamer pipelines in any form or shape and, near the end, plug our plugin so that it can be streamed to Moonlight. Figure 1. Our plugin sits between the encoded bitestream and a downstream UDP sink that will send the RTP packets to Moonlight The basic flow is the following: The plugin receives a GstBuffer of binary data: the encoded video or audio stream into a format that can be decoded back by the Moonlight client. We’ll split this into a GstBufferList of valid RTP packets following the Moonlight specifications; this includes: split the original buffer into a set of correctly sized chunks Encrypt the chunks when enabled add RTP headers to each chunk create additional RTP packets with the FEC information Push the resulting list downstream Figure 2. An example pipeline for video encoding and streaming Figure 3. An example pipeline for audio encoding and streaming This flow is general enough to enable us to use the same plugin for H.264, HEVC and AV1 (and any other encoder that will be supported in future). Downstream, it’s also trivial to switch between UDP/TCP or even a complete different delivery method if needed. We decided to split between audio and video because they have different RTP packet structure, non overlapping properties, different FEC encoding and different encryption requirements but the basic flow is the same for both plugins. Given that this is a direct transformation from one input buffer to another output buffer we decided to use GstBaseTransform as the base class. This will implement some boilerplate code for us so that we can focus on the main _transform virtual method implementation. Following the nomenclature used in the official GStreamer RTP plugins we called them rtpmoonlightpay_video and rtpmoonlightpay_audio as in RTP Moonlight Payloader video/audio. GStreamer uses GObjects: a mechanism to retrofit Objects into C. I suggest you to get a bit familiar with it before diving into the code; here’s a great and simple tutorial. Following the official docs at Plugin Write’s Guide we started off with the official bash script that creates the boilerplate code from the selected base class; namely: gstrtpmoonlightpay_video.hpp and gstrtpmoonlightpay_video.cpp contain all the boilerplate code needed to setup a plugin, property definitions, etc. gstrtpmoonlightpay_audio.hpp and gstrtpmoonlightpay_audio.cpp for audio. video.hpp contains all the functions that turns a linear buffer of data into a list of correctly formed RTP packets. audio.hpp same for audio","title":"GStreamer","component":"wolf","version":"stable","name":"gstreamer","url":"/wolf/stable/dev/gstreamer.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"The plugin","hash":"_the_plugin","id":2},{"text":"Code","hash":"_code","id":3}]},"23":{"id":23,"text":"This has been tested on Debian 12, you should adjust the setup based on your distro of choice.

You can just use ximagesrc and hook your host X11 desktop to the stream but there are some issues with that: Xorg has to be up and running; we can run it via Docker in GOW but that’s not without its challenges. You need a physical monitor or a dummy plugged into your GPU (or some esoteric EDID trick which works only when also performing a human sacrifice). It doesn’t scale well with multiple remote clients when sharing a single host Ideally, can’t we just plug the shared video memory from the running App straight into Gstreamer ?? In theory, for a single fullscreen application that’s kind of possible (read until the end to get an idea of why it’s not so simple); but we need some way to compose multiple running windows into a single scene to be then encoded via the Gstreamer pipeline. Turns out that’s exactly what a Compositing window manager (or compositor) does, and since you can’t have just a compositor without the full X Window System (X11) running, we decided to follow the Wayland route. We are in a very fortunate position: we don’t even want to deal with real monitors, we just want to be the glue between an application running and the Gstreamer pipeline; for this reason we can have a simplified view (and implementation). Figure 1. A high level overview of the main components Let’s dive into each of these parts in isolation. The Wayland protocol does not include a rendering API. Instead, Wayland follows a direct rendering model, in which the client must render the window contents to a buffer shareable with the compositor. — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(protocol)#Rendering_model By removing the X server from the picture we also removed the mechanism by which X clients typically render, but there’s another mechanism: direct rendering. With direct rendering, the client and the server share a video memory buffer. The client links to a rendering library such as OpenGL that knows how to program the hardware and renders directly into the buffer. The compositor in turn can take the buffer and use it as a texture when it composites the desktop. One simple way to implement this buffer would be to use shm as a simple shared region between clients and the server. Most Wayland compositors do their rendering on the GPU, and many Wayland clients do their rendering on the GPU as well. With the shared memory approach, sending buffers from the client to the compositor in such cases is very inefficient, as the client has to read their data from the GPU to the CPU, then the compositor has to read it from the CPU back to the GPU to be rendered. The Linux DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) interface provides a means for us to export handles to GPU resources. Mesa, the predominant implementation of userspace Linux graphics drivers, implements a protocol that allows EGL users to transfer handles to their GPU buffers from the client to the compositor for rendering, without ever copying data to the GPU. Wayland is designed to update everything atomically, such that no frame is ever presented in an invalid or intermediate state. Our custom Wayland compositor knows where to get the rendered buffers, but it doesn’t know when the buffer is ready to be rendered; here’s where the Wayland protocol comes into play. Client surfaces will start in a pending state (and no state at all when first created), this state is negotiated over the course of any number of requests from clients and events from the server; when both sides agree that it’s a consistent surface, the surface is committed. Until this time, the compositor will continue to render the last consistent state. In Wayland, instead of continuously pushing new frames, you can let the compositor tell you when it’s ready for a new frame using frame callbacks. The compositor must finally compose the various surfaces into a single image, in order to do that efficiently we’ll also use EGL. Figure 2. The compositor communicates with the apps via the Wayland protocol, and compose surfaces via EGL Our compositor finally composed an image, and we are ready to send this to our Moonlight client, how do we push this to the selected encoder in the Gstreamer pipeline without copying? Sad news is, we don’t (at least currently). Although Gstreamer supports DMA Buffers (Direct Memory Access) which are an efficient way to share memory without going through the CPU, the support for modifiers of DMA Buffers is lacking behind significantly and varyies from one plugin to the next. What are modifiers? Modifiers add additional vendor specific properties to the internal pixel layout of a buffer. These modifiers are usually internally used by the GPU to speed up certain operations depending on characteristics of the hardware. None of this really has to worry us, because all of that is handled by the gpu driver. But because DMA buffers exist outside of the scope of a singular device, we need to carry the modifier of the buffer along. If it gets lost on the way, the program receiving the buffer has no idea how the data is layed out in memory and will likely output a broken image. Modifiers as such a crucial for communicating formats across devices, but they haven’t existed all the time. So called \"explicit\" modifiers are a relatively new addition to the apis in question. Previously the drivers managed modifiers internally without exposing them to the user. Buffers without an accompanying modifier are as such described as having an \"implicit\" modifier. Because the modifier is handled internally by the driver communication across devices is impossible with such a buffer. Because these changes are relatively new, a lot of software still has to adapt to the new explicit apis and many try to be able to handle both, implicit and explicit buffers. Gstreamer being composed of many plugins currently results in very different stages of transitioning between these apis. Some apis even got support for explicit modifiers, only to drop it a release later, because users of older plugins were complaining about incompatibilities…​ This means the chance of getting a good image out of the pipeline starting with a DMA Buffer is very small. Given the state of things, we are currently copying the buffer through host-memory once to side-step this issue for now. The plan for the future is to provide first an experimental option for using DMA buffers, and later with more testing and development we will hopefully be able to share, compose and finally encode different buffer types with zero memory copied between the GPU and the CPU for truely the best possible latency.

RTSP messages are plaintext packets of variable size over TCP. Parsing of RTSP messages has been implemented using a formal PEG (Parsing Expression Grammars) definition; you can find it in parser.hpp. There are two types of message: request and response All messages have the following structure: message: required options: optional, zero or more key value options separated by newline payload: optional, extra unstructured data that needs to be passed. An example request message OPTIONS rtsp://192.168.1.100:48010 RTSP/1.0 (1) CSeq: 1 (2) X-GS-ClientVersion: 14 (3) (4) a=fmtp:97 surround-params=21101 (5) 1 message: 2 option 1 3 option 2 4 empty new line (end of options) 5 payload The message part is the first line, it’s delimited by the newline character (\\r\\n) , and it’s composed by: command: the first string, delimited by , the command to be executed on the backend; one of: [OPTIONS, DESCRIBE, SETUP, ANNOUNCE, PLAY] target: the second string, delimited by , specifies the ip address and port that is the target of the session. protocol: last string, delimited by , the RTSP protocol in use. Optional additional key values to be passed, delimited by the newline character (\\r\\n). The end of the options section is marked by an extra newline character (\\r\\n). Honorable mention goes to CSeq which is always present and represent the sequence number. Any extra unstructured text that it’s added after the end of the options before the end of the message will be parsed as the payload. Like requests, responses have a message, zero or more options and an optional payload. The main difference is in the format of the message. You can easily identify a response package by looking at the command part which is always RTSP. An example response message RTSP/1.0 200 OK (1) CSeq: 1 (2) a=fmtp:97 surround-params=21101 (3) 1 message 2 option 3 payload Unlike requests a message in a response is composed by different parts: protocol: it’s always RTSP/* and it’s the easiest way to discriminate between request and response messages. status code: follows the HTTP status codes specification status string: follows the HTTP status codes specification","title":"RTSP","component":"wolf","version":"stable","name":"rtsp","url":"/wolf/stable/protocols/rtsp.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"RTSP specifications","hash":"_rtsp_specifications","id":2},{"text":"Request message","hash":"_request_message","id":3},{"text":"Message","hash":"_message","id":4},{"text":"Options","hash":"_options","id":5},{"text":"Payload","hash":"_payload","id":6},{"text":"Response message","hash":"_response_message","id":7},{"text":"Message","hash":"_message_2","id":8}]},"32":{"id":32,"text":"Wolf is configured via a TOML config file and some additional optional ENV variables Variable Default Description WOLF_LOG_LEVEL INFO The log level to show, one of ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE WOLF_CFG_FILE /etc/wolf/cfg/config.toml Full path to the config file WOLF_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE /etc/wolf/cfg/key.pem Full path to the key.pem file WOLF_PRIVATE_CERT_FILE /etc/wolf/cfg/cert.pem Full path to the cert.pem file XDG_RUNTIME_DIR /tmp/sockets The full path where PulseAudio and video sockets will reside, this path is expected to be present in the host and mounted in the Wolf container WOLF_PULSE_IMAGE ghcr.io/games-on-whales/pulseaudio:master The name of the PulseAudio image to be started (when no connection is available) WOLF_STOP_CONTAINER_ON_EXIT TRUE Set to False in order to avoid force stop and removal of containers when the connection is closed WOLF_DOCKER_SOCKET /var/run/docker.sock The full path to the docker socket, doesn’t support tcp (yet) NVIDIA_DRIVER_VOLUME_NAME nvidia-driver-vol The name of the externally created Docker Volume that holds the Nvidia drivers HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER /etc/wolf The base folder in the host where the running apps will store permanent state WOLF_RENDER_NODE /dev/dri/renderD128 The default render node used for virtual desktops; see: Multiple GPUs WOLF_DOCKER_FAKE_UDEV_PATH $HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER/fake-udev The path on the host for the fake-udev CLI tool Additional env variables useful when debugging: Variable Default Description RUST_BACKTRACE full In case an exception is thrown in the Rust code, this sets the backtrace level GST_DEBUG 2 Gstreamer debug print, see debugging-tools The TOML configuration file is read only once at startup (or created if not present) and it’ll be modified by Wolf only when a new user is successfully paired.

In order to automatically pick up the right encoder at runtime based on the user HW we run in order the list of encoders at gstreamer.video.hevc_encoders (and gstreamer.video.h264_encoders); the first set of plugins that can be correctly initialised by Gstreamer will be the selected encoder for all the pipelines. You can read more about gstreamer and custom pipelines in the Gstreamer page. When you have multiple GPUs installed in your host, you might want to have better control over which one is used by Wolf and how. There are two main separated parts that make use of HW acceleration in Wolf: Gstreamer video encoding: this will use HW acceleration in order to efficiently encode the video stream with H.264 or HEVC. App render node: this will use HW acceleration in order to create virtual Wayland desktops and run the chosen app (ex: Firefox, Steam, …​) They can be configured separately, and ideally you could even use two GPUs at the same time for different jobs; a common setup would be to use the integrated GPU just for the streaming part and use a powerful GPU to play apps/games. The streaming video encoding pipeline is fully controlled by the config.toml file; here the order in which entries are listed is important because Wolf will just try each listed plugin; the first one that works is the one that will be used. If you have an Intel iGPU and a Nvidia card in the same host, and you would like to use QuickSync in order to do the encoding, you can either: Delete the nvcodec entries under gstreamer.video.hevc_encoders Cut the qsv entry and paste it above the nvcodec entry On top of that, each single apps entry support overriding the default streaming pipeline; for example: [[apps]] title = \"Test ball\" # More options here, removed for brevity... [apps.video] source = \"\"\" videotestsrc pattern=ball flip=true is-live=true ! video/x-raw, framerate={fps}/1 \\ \"\"\" In case you have two GPUs that will use the same encoder pipeline (example: an AMD iGPU and an AMD GPU card) you can override the encoder_pipeline with the corresponding encoder plugin; see: gstreamer/issues/1167. Each application that Wolf will start will have access only to a specific render node even if the host has multiple GPUs connected. By default, Wolf will use the env variable WOLF_RENDER_NODE which defaults to /dev/dri/renderD128 If you don’t know which render node is associated with which GPU you can use the following command: ls -l /sys/class/drm/renderD*/device/driver /sys/class/drm/renderD128/device/driver -> ../../../../bus/virtio/drivers/virtio_gpu (1) /sys/class/drm/renderD129/device/driver -> ../../../../bus/pci/drivers/nvidia (2) 1 This line will tell you that renderD128 is a virtual GPU 2 This line will tell you that renderD129 is a Nvidia GPU Wolf supports also overriding the render node in each single app defined in the config.toml config file by setting the render_node property; example: [apps.runner] type = \"docker\" name = \"WolfSteam\" image = \"ghcr.io/games-on-whales/steam:edge\" # More options here, removed for brevity... render_node = \"/dev/dri/renderD129\"","title":"Configuration","component":"wolf","version":"stable","name":"configuration","url":"/wolf/stable/user/configuration.html","titles":[{"text":"ENV variables","hash":"_env_variables","id":1},{"text":"TOML file","hash":"_toml_file","id":2},{"text":"Defining apps","hash":"_defining_apps","id":3},{"text":"App Runner","hash":"_app_runner","id":4},{"text":"Process","hash":"_process","id":5},{"text":"Docker","hash":"_docker","id":6},{"text":"Gstreamer","hash":"_gstreamer","id":7},{"text":"Multiple GPUs","hash":"_multiple_gpu","id":8},{"text":"Gstreamer video encoding","hash":"_gstreamer_video_encoding","id":9},{"text":"App render node","hash":"_app_render_node","id":10}]},"33":{"id":33,"text":"To list the installed plugins use: gst-inspect-1.0 To analyse some media use: gst-discoverer-1.0 -v https://storage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4 To test out pipelines in your system use: gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! autovideosink See more examples at: matthew1000/gstreamer-cheat-sheet [[apps]] title = \"Desktop\" [apps.video] source = \"avfvideosrc capture-screen-cursor=true capture-screen=true\" This works in OSX, for X11 you can use ximagesrc or on Wayland you can try: pipewiresrc Here the trick is to use shmsink and shmsrc in order to share the raw audio between the video and audio pipeline: [[apps]] title = \"Music\" # Audio sample downloaded from https://www.bensound.com/free-music-for-videos # try also: spacescope style=color-lines [apps.video] source = \"\"\" filesrc location=/Users/ale/Downloads/elevate.mp3 ! tee name=t ! queue ! shmsink socket-path=/tmp/pipe.sock shm-size=10000000 t. ! decodebin ! audioconvert ! wavescope style=color-lines \"\"\" # Get the audio info using: # gst-discoverer-1.0 -v elevate.mp3 [apps.audio] source = \"\"\" shmsrc socket-path=/tmp/pipe.sock do-timestamp=true ! audio/mpeg, mpegversion=(int)1, mpegaudioversion=(int)1, layer=(int)3, rate=(int)44100, channels=(int)2 ! decodebin \"\"\" Here the trick is to use shmsink and shmsrc in order to share the raw audio between the video and audio pipeline: [[apps]] title = \"BigBuckBunny (MP4 - remote)\" [apps.video] # taken from https://gist.github.com/jsturgis/3b19447b304616f18657 source = \"\"\" curlhttpsrc location=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4\" ! qtdemux name=demux demux.audio_0 ! queue ! shmsink socket-path=/tmp/pipe.sock shm-size=10000000 demux.video_0 ! decodebin \\ \"\"\" # Get the audio info using: # gst-discoverer-1.0 -v https://storage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4 [apps.audio] source = \"\"\" shmsrc socket-path=/tmp/pipe.sock do-timestamp=true ! audio/mpeg, mpegversion=(int)4, framed=(boolean)true, stream-format=(string)raw, level=(string)2, base-profile=(string)lc, profile=(string)lc, codec_data=(buffer)1210, rate=(int)44100, channels=(int)2 ! decodebin \"\"\" Here the trick is to use shmsink and shmsrc in order to share the raw audio between the video and audio pipeline: [[apps]] title = \"Twitch.tv\" [apps.video] # location is the result of # youtube-dl --format mp4 --get-url https://www.twitch.tv/videos/560738950 source = \"\"\" curlhttpsrc location=\"https://dqrpb9wgowsf5.cloudfront.net/49e35d90a96078583c9c_andrewfoxtv_34248972186_2596839032/chunked/highlight-560738950.m3u8\" ! hlsdemux ! tsdemux name=demux demux.audio_0_0100 ! queue ! shmsink socket-path=/tmp/pipe.sock shm-size=10000000 demux.video_0_0101 ! queue ! decodebin \\ \"\"\" # Get the audio info using: # gst-discoverer-1.0 -v https://dqrpb9wgowsf5.cloudfront.net/49e35d90a96078583c9c_andrewfoxtv_34248972186_2596839032/chunked/highlight-560738950.m3u8 [apps.audio] source = \"\"\" shmsrc socket-path=/tmp/pipe.sock do-timestamp=true ! audio/mpeg, framed=(boolean)true, mpegversion=(int)4, level=(string)2, base-profile=(string)lc, profile=(string)lc, rate=(int)44100, channels=(int)2, stream-format=(string)adts ! decodebin \"\"\" The element compositor allows video to be mixed (overlayed, put side-by-side, etc).

KERNEL==\"uinput\", SUBSYSTEM==\"misc\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", OPTIONS+=\"static_node=uinput\" Allows Wolf to access /dev/uinput on your system.

SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{id/vendor}==\"ab00\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", ENV{ID_SEAT}=\"seat9\" This line checks for the custom vendor-id that Wolf gives to newly created virtual devices and assigns them to seat9, which will cause any session with a lower seat (usually you only have seat1 for your main session) to ignore the devices.

The easiest way is to follow the examples that already exist; one particularly good option is the RetroArch app that is bundled with GoW. Once you have your app working as you like it, consider submitting a pull request to add it to the official repo! First you’ll need a Docker container for your app. It’s possible that one may already exist, but if not, creating one is pretty easy. Copy the images/retroarch directory and all of its contents to a new directory for your app; let’s call it images/myapp. Inside the configs directory, you can put default versions of any configuration files that may be needed by your app. If there aren’t any, you can simply delete the configs directory. In the scripts directory, edit the startup.sh script. Here’s an example of a minimal startup.sh script; you can modify it for your app as much as necessary. #!/bin/bash set -e source /opt/gow/bash-lib/utils.sh gow_log \"Starting myapp\" exec /usr/bin/myapp Our Docker images are based on the latest Ubuntu LTS release, and you should be able to easily repurpose the RetroArch Dockerfile for your application as long as it can be installed on Ubuntu. Here are a few specifics that you’ll definitely want to update: Be sure to update the REQUIRED_PACKAGES variable to include all of the packages your app will need to have installed when it’s running. You can use the add-apt-repository tool in your RUN command to add any extra package repositories you might need to install from. Be sure to change the line that installs the configuration file to install the files required by your app. In the compose/apps directory, copy retroarch.yml to myapp.yml. Make sure the build context is pointing to images/myapp, and also be sure to set the image: appropriately.","title":"Adding an App","component":"gow","version":"","name":"adding-an-app","url":"/gow/adding-an-app.html","titles":[{"text":"The Container","hash":"_the_container","id":1},{"text":"Configuration","hash":"_configuration","id":2},{"text":"Scripts","hash":"_scripts","id":3},{"text":"Dockerfile","hash":"_dockerfile","id":4},{"text":"REQUIRED_PACKAGES","hash":"_required_packages","id":5},{"text":"add-apt-repository","hash":"_add_apt_repository","id":6},{"text":"COPY","hash":"_copy","id":7},{"text":"The Compose file","hash":"_the_compose_file","id":8}]},"38":{"id":38,"text":"Make sure to read the overview section before continuing, to get a grasp on core concept behind GOW. GOW is a composition of Docker containers that enable users to stream graphical applications to Moonlight clients. We wrapped each individual piece of software with the necessary dependencies into its own Docker image and use docker-compose in order to manage the composition of all the necessary pieces. The streaming host is the heart of this system; it’s in charge of: Encoding the graphical environment (Xorg) and audio (PulseAudio) into a video that will be streamed to Moonlight clients This process can be hardware accelerated using VAAPI or CUDA depending on your GPU hardware Translating remote input devices into local input devices (eg: keyboards, mice, gamepads) This is achieved by using the uinput kernel module. Games on Whales currently has support for two streaming hosts: Sunshine (more mature, and the default), and Wolf (still in alpha, but very usable). These two components are in charge of Display and Audio, respectively. If your OS comes with a desktop environment already, you will most likely want to use that instead of trying to run it in a container. If you’re running a headless system you’ll need to run them in order to run graphical applications. You can use our Docker images for that. While PulseAudio runs just fine without a real sound device, for best results Xorg should be hardware accelerated using a GPU. That’s the main reason why we choose the full Xorg server over Xvfb. While it’s more complicated to run the full Xorg server, the benefits of having hardware acceleration are too great to be dismissed. Graphical applications can run easily on top of Xorg and PulseAudio — that’s how most desktop environments work! Sharing sockets between containers is the mechanism that enables us to have proper isolation. Instead of having a big single Docker image which installs and runs all the individual pieces of software together, we can decouple them and share only a communication channel. This means that it’s very simple to make a Docker container of any given GUI application and that same container will work both on GOW or on a normal Desktop Environment, enabling users to have a high degree of freedom on how to use them. A GPU is not required to run any of this, but it’s highly recommended for best results. Sharing a GPU across Docker containers is generally done by sharing the DRM devices (/dev/dri/cardX). This should work as long as your GPU supports VA-API. Notably, NVIDIA cards don’t; instead we provide specific instructions for them.","title":"Components Overview","component":"gow","version":"","name":"components-overview","url":"/gow/components-overview.html","titles":[{"text":"Streaming host","hash":"_streaming_host","id":1},{"text":"Xorg & PulseAudio","hash":"_xorg_pulseaudio","id":2},{"text":"GUIs","hash":"_guis","id":3},{"text":"GPU","hash":"_gpu","id":4}]},"39":{"id":39,"text":"Before launching GoW for the first time, you’ll want to set up your environment to your tastes. GoW is set up to use a directory of your choice from your host system as a place to store anything that needs to persist when you stop and restart containers. Because this same directory is (typically) mapped into each container, it can also be a way to share data between multiple containers. Before you launch GoW for the first time, create a new directory and update the LOCAL_STATE variable in your User environment to match. On unRAID, the local_state folder you just created will likely be owned by root, and it may not be writable from the containers launched by GoW, which mostly do not run as root. Until GoW has support for changing the UID inside the containers, you may need to chmod 777 local_state to make sure anyone can write to it. In order to make the time zone inside your container match your actual local time zone, you’ll need to update the TIME_ZONE variable in your [User environment]. If you’re not sure what to set it to, check out this list of tz database time zones. Your user environment is typically stored in the user.env file in the directory you cloned GoW into. It contains a simple list of environment variables, one per line. Comments and blank lines are allowed, but variable substitutions are not.

You can manually check if the images are being tampered with by doing the following: Head over to the Actions section on Github and open up the build that you want to check For each generated Docker image there’s a step called Image digest – this is the sha256 checksum of the image generated on Github Head over to the Docker hub and check that the sha256 checksum for the image and the sha256 checksum for the commit are the same as it’s displayed in Github Here’s an example from the commit 98e5080 The associated Github Action for the xorg image reports: xorg > sha256:6b8555260ed07c7ed466e0b821922a3cedf4ee27b9d6b8fea9d6aa2995b75f61 The image layer details on the Docker Hub reports: gameonwhales/xorg:sha-98e5080 Digest:sha256:6b8555260ed07c7ed466e0b821922a3cedf4ee27b9d6b8fea9d6aa2995b75f61 You sure can! Here’s what you’ll need to know. We have two images that are only used as the base for our other images; they aren’t ever launched by themselves and therefore they don’t appear in the compose files. Since they don’t appear in the compose files, docker compose can’t automatically build them. Instead, you must specify which images to use as environment variables, found in env/build.env. If you want to build the base images yourself too, that’s no problem. First build the base image: sudo DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t my-gow-base images/base Then the base-app image, passing the base image you just built as a build arg: sudo DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=my-gow-base -t my-gow-base-app images/base-app Lastly, edit env/build.env to specify your newly built images to be used for future compose builds: BUILD_BASE_IMAGE=my-gow-base BUILD_BASE_APP_IMAGE=my-gow-base-app You can, of course, choose any tags you like instead of my-gow-base and my-gow-base-app. Any of the app or system images described in the compose files can be easily built using the run-gow script. First, edit the appropriate compose YAML files and uncomment the build: section, to let docker compose know you want to build those images rather than pulling it from a registry. You may also want to comment out the image: lines to make sure there’s no confusion.

Absolutely! Streaming games works very well, but GoW can do so much more! Out of the box, GoW provides a platform for running just about any graphical applications you like. In fact, despite the name, you can think of GoW as a low-latency remote desktop solution. Often the focus is on a single full-screen application, but this does not necessarily have to be the case. You should be able to run any Graphical Application on top of the basic combination of Xorg + PulseAudio + Sunshine. We supply the necessary configuration files for steam, retroarch, and firefox by default, but you can use them as templates to create your own. See Adding an App for more details. GoW is even often capable of running containers provided by third parties; as long as the container can accept a DISPLAY environment variable to specify the Xorg display, it can be made to work. For example, this Firefox container (andrewmackrodt/firefox-x11) is an open-source Dockerfile and image. It’s a great example of running a container which wasn’t built with GOW in mind. This container doesn’t need to be run any special privileges or network mode , because mouse and keyboard events are handled by Xorg and passing the X11 socket is enough to have display and inputs. This increases security for non trusted containers by restricting what’s accessible inside the container. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for gamepads; if your container requires gamepad support you’ll need to use privileged: true and network_mode: ${UDEVD_NETWORK} just like in the RetroArch example. This is required because the device files for the gamepad do not exist at the time the container is launched (they’re only created once a client connects) and so far the only way we’ve found for a running container to see a newly created device file is using the privileged setting.

There are a couple of ways to handle this situaion. Nothing more to say, really. If you have an actual monitor, and you can get it physically close to your server, you can just use that. The Xorg desktop will show on the monitor, though, which may be undesirable. You can get dummy plugs for HDMI and DisplayPort that pretend to be a monitor by returning built-in EDID data when plugged in. They’re relatively inexpensive, and they don’t take up much space, so this is a popular option. You can also unplug the dummy and plug in a monitor as needed, which may or may not be a benefit depending on your situation. By setting up some custom configuration, you can force Xorg to behave as though a monitor is plugged in even when nothing is. This sounds like a slam-dunk for \"best overall option\" but the configuration is significantly more complex than simply plugging in a dummy, so it’s not necessarily the best option for everyone. Below is a summary of the changes you’ll need to make. EDID data is how Xorg determines what resolutions and timings your monitor supports without having to be explicitly configured for it. In the headless case we’re setting up, that means that the EDID file you supply needs to declare support for whatever resolution you want to run at. The exact steps for creating an EDID file will vary wildly depending on your setup and goals, so it’s a bit beyond the scope of this guide. Having said that, here are some pointers. The EDID file can either be a .bin binary file containing the exact 256 bytes of EDID data, or it can be a .txt file where each byte is represented as 2 hexadecimal characters, with the bytes separated by spaces. For example, this file, which has support for several resolutions up to 1920x1080. If that file doesn’t meet your needs, you still have options. One possibility is to read in the EDID from a connected monitor and use that. Alternatively, you can try to generate your own file using a tool like edid-generator, but that’s not something we’ve tested before. Create a new file somewhere called xorg-screen.conf. In it, put this configuration: Section \"Screen\" Identifier \"Screen0\" Device \"Device0\" Monitor \"Monitor0\" DefaultDepth 24 Option \"AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration\" \"True\" Option \"UseDisplayDevice\" \"DP-0\" Option \"CustomEDID\" \"DP-0:/home/retro/edid.txt\" Option \"ConnectedMonitor\" \"DP-0\" SubSection \"Display\" Depth 24 EndSubSection EndSection Next, make sure Docker knows how to find your new configuration and EDID files. Add lines like these to the volumes section under xorg in your compose/headless.yml to mount them into the Xorg image. services: xorg: # ... volumes: # START ADDING HERE - /path/to/edid.txt:/home/retro/edid.txt:ro - /path/to/xorg-screen.conf:/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/01-xorg-screen.conf:ro # END ADDING HERE Last but not least, make sure the XORG_DISPLAY_PORT variable in env/headless.env is set to the same value as the UseDisplayDevice option in your xorg-screen.conf file. If you copied the snippet above, the correct value should be DP-0.

The goal is to allow a server to stream games to clients the same way you play a video on YouTube. A server is not necessarily a gigantic beast of a machine; in fact, GoW will probably run on hardware you already have, such as a laptop or desktop computer, or even something smaller and compact like a Raspberry Pi (in theory). Generally, you should be able to pick any OS that supports Docker and start using GoW, but testing and development are focused on Linux-based systems. We bring together a few different components: Platform Most of the software in the Games on Whales system runs in Docker containers. Containers are software packages that are designed to make installation and configuration easy by providing a consistent platform everywhere the package is run. You can choose to run GoW in either Host Desktop mode, or Headless mode. In Headless mode, we run a few platform containers for you: Xorg: The famous windowing system for managing and displaying graphical applications (GUI) PulseAudio: A sound server that can manage audio coming from multiple sources (apps). In Host Desktop mode, we expect the host server to provide those pieces. Streaming Server GoW streams running apps to clients using NVIDIA’s GameStream protocol. We provide a choice of two open-source server implementations. Although NVIDIA has announced that they are ending support for GameStream in early 2023, these open-source implementations (and thus GoW itself) do not rely on any NVIDIA support or infrastructure and will continue to work even after that date. Sunshine: The original open-source GameStream host, and still the most well-tested. Use this if you’re unsure which one to pick. Wolf: A new GameStream host, still in alpha. Client Moonlight is an open-source GameStream protocol client. Moonlight runs on many platforms, including: mobile phones, laptops, desktops, Steam Deck, and even the Nintendo Switch! Moonlight is not distributed with GoW. You’ll need to install it on each device you plan to use as a client for playing games.

In order to make it easier to manage all that, and even make most of it automatic, we’ve provided a Bash script to handle the details for you. You can think of run-gow as a frontend for docker-compose; it takes some of its own arguments at the beginning, but passes everything else on untouched. The complete usage description is below, but first let’s talk about a few of the options you’re definitely going to want to set. The --platform option is used to specify whether the underlying Xorg and Pulse platform is provided by the host computer, or if GoW should launch containers for those components. Use --platform host to use the host’s platform, or --platform headless to launch the platform in containers. The default is --platform host. Some GPUs require extra configuration, so the --gpu option is available to tell run-gow which GPU you plan on using. Possible values are nvidia and intel. Notably, AMD GPUs are reported to be working well without any additional configuration, so you won’t need this option if you’re using AMD. If you’re running headless and you have more than one GPU, including if you have a dedicated GPU and an iGPU, you may need to manually tell Xorg which GPU to use. See here for details on how to do that. You should set the --gpu option appropriately for the GPU you plan to use. By default, if you launch GoW and connect with Moonlight, you’ll only see a basic desktop. However, it’s likely that you have at least one application in mind that you’d like to launch, and you can use the --app argument to specify that. Supported apps can be found in the compose/apps directory; just leave off the .yml: $ ./run-gow --app steam You can specify --app [app name] as many times as you like, if you want to launch multiple applications. run-gow Usage Launch the Games on Whales system Usage: run-gow [options] [compose commands] Arguments after the last option will be passed directly to 'docker compose'. For example, to launch the containers in the background, try: $ run-gow --app retroarch up -d Options: -h, --help Print this help text. -a, --app Specify an application to launch. Can be used multiple times. -d, --debug Print some extra debugging information before running Docker commands. -e, --env-file Specify an additional file of environment varibles to load before launching 'docker compose'. -g, --gpu Use this option to specify what type of GPU to use with Games on Whales. Not all GPU types require this option (notably, AMD does not). Possible types: nvidia, intel -p, --platform Use this option to specify whether system services like Xorg should be containerized or not. Possible values: headless - run xorg, udev, and pulse in containers host - use system services already running on the host server [default] -q, --quiet If set, this script will not produce any output of its own. This will not affect output from 'docker compose'. -s, --streamer Use this option to specify which streaming server should be used to connect with Moonlight. Possible values: sunshine - the original, more stable option [default] wolf - the bleeding edge option. still in beta. -x, --headless DEPRECATED. If set, has the same effect as '--platform headless' -- Signifies the end of options. Once you’ve got your system set up how you like it, you’ll find that many of the options you provide to run-gow won’t actually change very frequently, if at all. In order to cut down on the repetitiveness of always having to type those arguments every time you use run-gow, we’ve provided a mechanism to supply a set of \"default arguments\". You can do that by creating a file called $HOME/.config/gow/run-gow-rc that contains the defaults you’d like to use.

Check the logs at local_state/.steam/debian-installation/error.log for more info on the specific issue. Surprisingly, you can! And it’s fairly easy to do it using proton which is integrated in Steam via Steam Play. In order to enable it: Steam > Settings - Steam Play [✓] Enable Steam Play for supported titles (optional) [✓] Enable Steam Play for all other titles There are a lot of different places for logs; for example, each game logs in a different folder. Here are a few hints on where to look local_state/.steam/debian-installation/error.log This is where most of the issues with the Steam client are logged local_state/.config/ This is where games usually put log and config files. For example, local_state/.config/unity3d/NoBrakesGames/Human/Player.log is the log file for Human Fall Flat local_state/Steam/logs/bootstrap_log.txt This is the log file related to starting/updating the steam client","title":"Steam","component":"gow","version":"","name":"steam","url":"/gow/steam.html","titles":[{"text":"Can Steam see my GPU?","hash":"_can_steam_see_my_gpu","id":1},{"text":"UI: Why are all the Steam windows black?","hash":"_ui_why_are_all_the_steam_windows_black","id":2},{"text":"Can I run Windows games?","hash":"_can_i_run_windows_games","id":3},{"text":"Something is wrong!

If you’re having trouble with something and you don’t see it mentioned, or if you need more help solving your problem, feel free to open an issue or reach out on Discord! In order to be able to stream your desktop, you must meet the Monitor requirements. You can see more stats in Moonlight during the streaming if you press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S (see: all keyboard options). This means that your local_state folder as defined in the user.env file is not owned by user 1000. You can fix this by: sudo chown -R 1000:1000 local_state If keyboard and mouse are working it means that uinput, Xorg and Sunshine are correctly working. Gamepad devices are created by Sunshine on connection, only if the client has one attached. Gamepads are not handled by Xorg as input devices; instead they are directly accessed by the app that wants to use them. That’s why on containers that use gamepads have to run in privileged mode. network_mode: ${UDEVD_NETWORK} privileged: true Using the keyboard you can move using the arrows and get back to the previous menu by pressing backspace From the Main Menu > Online Updater select: Update Core Info Files Update assets Press F to toggle fullscreen if you need to. Xorg is logging more than what you can see from the command line; you can get the full log file at /var/log/Xorg.0.log from inside the Docker container. Running the following should copy it to your current directory, even if the container is no longer running: docker cp gow-xorg-1:/var/log/Xorg.0.log . If you’re running in headless mode, it’s likely that the file will be called Xorg.99.log instead of Xorg.0.log. I’m still not sure about this one, it happened to me when trying to start GOW on a Desktop system when the screen was locked. Unlocking the screen first and then running GOW solved the issue for me. Disabling modesetting might be another way to get around it.","title":"Troubleshooting","component":"gow","version":"","name":"troubleshooting","url":"/gow/troubleshooting.html","titles":[{"text":"Lag, slow, missing frames","hash":"_lag_slow_missing_frames","id":1},{"text":"mkdir: cannot create directory `/home/retro/sunshine/': Permission denied","hash":"_mkdir_cannot_create_directory_homeretrosunshine_permission_denied","id":2},{"text":"I can use my mouse and keyboard but my gamepad doesn’t work","hash":"_i_can_use_my_mouse_and_keyboard_but_my_gamepad_doesnt_work","id":3},{"text":"RetroArch is missing icons!","hash":"_retroarch_is_missing_icons","id":4},{"text":"How can I get the full logs of Xorg?","hash":"_how_can_i_get_the_full_logs_of_xorg","id":5},{"text":"Xorg: Failed to acquire modesetting permission","hash":"_xorg_failed_to_acquire_modesetting_permission","id":6}]},"57":{"id":57,"text":"In the Games on Whales system, the \"platform\" is the component that provides system-level services like Xorg, PulseAudio, and udev. We provide two options; \"Host Desktop\", which uses the services already provided on the host system, and \"Headless\", which launches those services in Docker containers. The goal of this page is to help you choose which one is best for your situation. Before we get to analyzing the pros and cons of each approach, we should first address the \"elephant in the room\" (as it were): it can be tricky, or even impossible, to run two separate instances of Xorg on the same computer. So, if you’re looking to host GoW on a system that already has a desktop, and therefore a running Xorg server, it may be that your only option is to run in \"Host Desktop\" mode. In this mode, only the streaming server and the applications are containerized. That may seem like a big loss, but there are still many benefits of containerizing applications as much as possible: It’s easy to control how much CPU and memory to allocate to each app that runs via Docker You don’t have to manage installation scripts, dependency conflicts, or updates — we’ll handle all of that for you You can easily delete all files created by the application simply by removing the container It’s easier to backup configuration files and state You may also want to check out x11docker: a project focused on running GUI apps on top of your existing desktop environment. This is where GoW really shines! We’ll take care of running and configuring: A desktop environment With audio Inside Docker That can support HW acceleration And with a streaming solution that: Is low latency Supports keyboard, mouse and gamepads Can be hardware accelerated !!! On top of that foundation layer you can run most of the GUI applications out there and even games!","title":"Platforms","component":"gow","version":"","name":"which-platform","url":"/gow/which-platform.html","titles":[{"text":"The Decision May be Made For You","hash":"_the_decision_may_be_made_for_you","id":1},{"text":"Host Desktop mode","hash":"_host_desktop_mode","id":2},{"text":"Headless mode","hash":"_headless_mode","id":3}]},"58":{"id":58,"text":"Given the popularity of Windows as a desktop OS, it’s natural to wonder if the Games on Whales system can be run on Windows. Unfortunately, as of right now, the answer is \"no, not really\". There are a couple of reasons why: Windows as a Server OS Although Windows is popular as a desktop OS, and there are certainly many server solutions built on top of Windows, it really isn’t a very common server OS in home/hobbyist setups. Docker on Windows Docker on Windows requires an extra layer of virtualization that can slow things down, and even cause extra headaches, particularly when networking is involved. WSL2 WSL2 is missing the uinput kernel module, and although we have been able to build the module ourselves, Xorg still fails to launch after doing so. That should be a solvable problem, but it will require some investigation to get going. For those reasons, we believe that on Windows, your best bet is to just install Sunshine and other applications like you normally would, even though it means foregoing the benefits of containerization. Having said that, we’re open to the idea that that may not always be the case, and we’re open to new ideas and efforts to make progress on running GoW on Windows.
