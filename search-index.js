intelligent wolf is better than a foolish lion. — Matshona Dhliwayo. Wolf is an open source streaming server for Moonlight that allows you to share a single server with multiple remote clients in order to play videogames! It’s made from the ground up with the following primary goals: Allow multiple users to stream different content by sharing a single remote host hardware On demand creation of virtual desktops with full support for any resolution/FPS without the need for a monitor or a dummy plug. Allow multiple GPUs to be used simultaneously for different jobs Example: stream encoding on iGPU whilst gaming on GPU Provide low latency video and audio stream with full support for gamepads Linux and Docker first: run your games with low privileges in containers (based on Games On Whales) Mostly hackable, just edit the config file to modify encoding pipelines, GPU settings or Docker/Podman low level details It’s a specific tool for a specific need, are you looking for a general purpose streaming solution?

We (try to) follow a functional programming paradigm where all the methods take immutable inputs and returns new outputs; this has great benefits: Given the highly parallel nature of Wolf, we can easily share immutable data structures to multiple threads without having to deal with race conditions. This gives us the power to support multiple concurrent users effortlessly. Code can easily be re-used by other projects since every part is highly decoupled. Enables testing most of the implemented methods in isolation. We are also trying to isolate the Moonlight protocol from the actual implementation so that we can create a portable C++ library of stateless methods, where possible, the code has been separated in logical modules. High-level utilities and re-usable libraries, not strictly tied to Moonlight or Wolf: docker.hpp: using libcurl and boost json to interrogate the Docker socket and provide an easy to use interface to most methods. input.hpp: an easy to use virtual input device library; supports mouse, keyboard, joypads and more! virtual-display.hpp: a simple abstraction on top of games-on-whales/gst-wayland-display in order to create and control virtual desktops. audio.hpp: a simple abstraction on top of libpulse to create and control virtual audio devices. A little standalone CLI tool that enables us to generate udev events. You can read more about the rationale behind it in Hotplug in Docker. Here we define core Moonlight functions in order to create the foundation for a platform-agnostic portable library. It currently hosts the followings: HTTP/S protocol interface: protocol.hpp Control protocol packet format control.hpp Reed Solomon FEC header fec.hpp Based on top of sleepybishop/nanors RTSP message parser parser.hpp Built using yhirose/cpp-peglib by writing a formal PEG (Parsing Expression Grammars) definition for all messages This is where the final Wolf executable will be built, contains all the additional code and logic required to run the full Moonlight server. In order to keep modules decoupled most of the logic revolves around reacting to events in a shared event bus (implemented using DeveloperPaul123/eventbus). Unit tests will live under tests/ and are written using the Catch2 framework. We are implementing unit tests for most of the methods and (where possible) also mocking packets/requests seen during real Moonlight sessions. Some of them are platform/HW specific; they are all enabled by default, you should disable them based on your platform.

A working example: connecting a joypad to the client triggers the right detection in RetroArch running in the server. Wolf creates virtual devices on-demand based on the packets that are received from Moonlight clients over the control stream. When a new virtual device is created, we have to \"mount\" it inside the right running Docker container since, in order to achieve isolation, we can’t run them with the privileged flag. Normally, Docker assigns devices available to a container at creation time. Fortunately, it supports a more permissive rule that allows to access a wider range of devices based on the device major:minor. By adding the --device-cgroup-rule we can then call mknod [1] from inside the container in order to mount the virtual devices on-demand from the outside. Example Docker command issued by Wolf docker exec -it sh -c \"mknod /dev/input/ c :\" We’ve mounted the right device into the right container, still, no application is picking it up [2]. We have to trigger some kind of \"event\" in order to advertise that a new device has arrived, turns out those kind of events are generated by udev. An example udev event when you plug a joypad UDEV [3588.199301] add /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.3/0000:02:00.0/usb1/1-1/1-1:1.3/0003:054C:0CE6.0007/input/input20/js0 (input) ACTION=add SUBSYSTEM=input DEVNAME=/dev/input/js0 ID_BUS=usb ID_MODEL=Wireless_Controller ID_SERIAL=Sony_Interactive_Entertainment_Wireless_Controller ID_VENDOR=Sony_Interactive_Entertainment ID_VENDOR_ENC=Sony\\x20Interactive\\x20Entertainment ID_VENDOR_ID=054c ID_REVISION=0100 ID_TYPE=hid ID_USB_VENDOR_ID=054c ID_USB_REVISION=0100 ID_USB_TYPE=hid ID_USB_DRIVER=usbhid MAJOR=13 MINOR=0 The first approach is to just pass the udev socket (and db files, more on this later) from the host. Sure, every application will get the event that a new device has been plugged, so this kind of defeats isolation; but since we are mounting only in one container, this should still work, right? Unfortunately, there’s another issue: when Wolf creates a new virtual device, it will in turn automatically trigger the udev event to be \"broadcast\" to every listening application and if this happens before we are able to mknod the device it’ll result in an application that can’t access the device that we’ve created. We want to be able to be in control of exactly when these events will be sent so that the flow is as follows: Figure 2. The order here matters, the udev events must be sent after the mount Since we have no control over udev and we can’t mount a device before it’s created we have to replicate the events that are generated by it and broadcast them in the same way to all listening applications. First, let’s take a step back; how are application communicating with udev? Though udev runs in userspace, it is highly entangled with the Linux kernel. The first entry that recognizes device insertion/deletion events is surely the Linux kernel. While there were no mechanisms for the Linux kernel to push notifications to userspace processes (with ioctl() the kernel can only provide responses for the corresponding requests from userspace processes), netlink IPC mechanism emerged and currently it is available for the kernel to send a notification first. — https://insujang.github.io/2018-11-27/udev-device-manager-for-the-linux-kernel-in-userspace/ Normally udevd does the following steps: Listens for kernel events via the netlink socket (GROUP_KERNEL) When it receives a new device event, it’ll run all the rules that are defined Send back the \"augmented\" message via another netlink socket (GROUP_UDEV) The two different groups are crucial, whilst every user application can listen the GROUP_KERNEL events only the kernel can be the origin for those messages. GROUP_UDEV being an user space group instead can be \"impersonated\" by any user space application [3]. Since this will run in Docker there’s an additional mechanism that we have to keep in mind: network namespaces. Since udevd communicates via netlink a container that doesn’t run with --network=host will not receive those events; we’ll have to run our custom udev sender inside the container network namespace in order to achieve full isolation. There are 3 main components that needs to be \"faked\" in order for tricking programs that are using libudev into using our fake events: create a file under /run/udev/control this is not used for anything else apart from detection that udev is present AFAIU. send a valid NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT event via netlink using GROUP_UDEV generate the appropriate DB entries in /run/udev/data/ these are just plain text files where the filename is just c: and the content is roughly the same as the event message payload The result of all this is our little CLI utility called fake-udev which we’ll install into our containers and call with our custom-generated events after mknod. echo -ne \\\"ACTION=add\\\\0DEVNAME=input/bomb\\\\0DEVPATH=/devices/bomb\\\\0SEQNUM=1234\\\\0SUBSYSTEM=input\\\\0\\\" | base64 | sudo fake-udev # `udevadm monitor` should print something like: UDEV [3931.403835] add /devices/bomb (input) These steps will finally achieve proper hotplug detection by the applications that are running inside a Docker container without exposing any udev event/file from the host filesystem. Luckily, reversing the steps is enough to also correctly unplug devices. First off, a huge thanks goes to John McDonough for all the help in figuring most of this stuff out and for leading the way with his prototype JohnCMcDonough/virtual-gamepad. 1. This obviously requires also the MKNOD capability to be enabled (--cap-add MKNOD) 2. Some application might react to the new device if it’s using inotify, unfortunately, this is not the default behaviour in most apps/games 3.

The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing. — gstreamer.freedesktop.org We implemented two custom plugins (one for video and one for audio) in order to turn a stream of bytes into a stream of valid Moonlight RTP packets. This allows users to be able to compose Gstreamer pipelines in any form or shape and, near the end, plug our plugin so that it can be streamed to Moonlight. Figure 1. Our plugin sits between the encoded bitestream and a downstream UDP sink that will send the RTP packets to Moonlight The basic flow is the following: The plugin receives a GstBuffer of binary data: the encoded video or audio stream into a format that can be decoded back by the Moonlight client. We’ll split this into a GstBufferList of valid RTP packets following the Moonlight specifications; this includes: split the original buffer into a set of correctly sized chunks Encrypt the chunks when enabled add RTP headers to each chunk create additional RTP packets with the FEC information Push the resulting list downstream Figure 2. An example pipeline for video encoding and streaming Figure 3. An example pipeline for audio encoding and streaming This flow is general enough to enable us to use the same plugin for H.264, HEVC and AV1 (and any other encoder that will be supported in future). Downstream, it’s also trivial to switch between UDP/TCP or even a complete different delivery method if needed. We decided to split between audio and video because they have different RTP packet structure, non overlapping properties, different FEC encoding and different encryption requirements but the basic flow is the same for both plugins. Given that this is a direct transformation from one input buffer to another output buffer we decided to use GstBaseTransform as the base class. This will implement some boilerplate code for us so that we can focus on the main _transform virtual method implementation. Following the nomenclature used in the official GStreamer RTP plugins we called them rtpmoonlightpay_video and rtpmoonlightpay_audio as in RTP Moonlight Payloader video/audio. GStreamer uses GObjects: a mechanism to retrofit Objects into C. I suggest you to get a bit familiar with it before diving into the code; here’s a great and simple tutorial. Following the official docs at Plugin Write’s Guide we started off with the official bash script that creates the boilerplate code from the selected base class; namely: gstrtpmoonlightpay_video.hpp and gstrtpmoonlightpay_video.cpp contain all the boilerplate code needed to setup a plugin, property definitions, etc. gstrtpmoonlightpay_audio.hpp and gstrtpmoonlightpay_audio.cpp for audio. video.hpp contains all the functions that turns a linear buffer of data into a list of correctly formed RTP packets. audio.hpp same for audio","title":"GStreamer","component":"wolf","version":"dev-fake-uinput","name":"gstreamer","url":"/wolf/dev-fake-uinput/dev/gstreamer.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"The plugin","hash":"_the_plugin","id":2},{"text":"Code","hash":"_code","id":3}]},"5":{"id":5,"text":"Wolf is composed of a few independent components that, when used together, allow us to run and stream multiple graphical applications on the same server without any overlap between them. In order to create virtual desktops on-demand, we’ve created a custom (micro) Wayland compositor: gst-wayland-display. It’s based on Smithay, coded in Rust and exposes both a standalone GStreamer plugin and an easy-to-use C API. The main benefit of this solution is that our compositor will then expose the raw framebuffer so that Wolf can feed that directly to the video encoding pipeline. You can read more about it in Headless Wayland. To keep things simple, our Wayland compositor doesn’t support XWayland, for containers that need it (like Steam) we use Gamescope which can be run as a Wayland client, and it’ll provide XWayland support to the downstream app. Audio doesn’t need any HW acceleration, it’s fairly trivial to run PulseAudio as a standalone container and use libpulse in order to create virtual audio sink on-demand. Creating and managing virtual devices is handled by inputtino: a small library that abstracts away the complexities of managing uinput (and uhid) to create virtual input devices. Virtual devices created by inputtino will be visible on the host system and can potentially break the host isolation that we’re trying to achieve. In order to avoid this, we encourage users to install a set of udev rules that will restrict access to these devices to a specific group (e.g. input) and move mouse and keyboard to a different seat (see user:quickstart.adoc#_virtual_devices_support). You can read a more detailed explanation into why we’ve added uhid and how gyro/acceleration is achieved here Some devices like mouse and keyboard are always present and will be automatically created and setup before starting the application. Other devices can be hotplugged whilst the streaming is running; for example, a gamepad can be plugged in after the game has started. Special care is needed in order to safely mount these new devices in the app container and to make them available to the running application, there’s an in-depth article about it here: Hotplug in Docker We run applications in a containerised environment, this way we can ensure that the application will not interfere with the host system (and with other running apps) and that it will have access only to the virtual devices that we’ve created. We have a set of pre-built containers that are optimised to work with our flow in games-on-whales/gow. Generally, though, most of the GUI applications should work inside a container that can then be streamed via Wolf. We use GStreamer to encode the video and audio streams and send them to the client. We have automatic support for HW acceleration using CUDA, QuickSync and VAAPI but thanks to GStreamer we can easily add more encoders into the mix, without having to write a single line of code! The full encoding pipeline is described in a string that can be overridden by users just by changing the config.toml file.

You can just use ximagesrc and hook your host X11 desktop to the stream but there are some issues with that: Xorg has to be up and running; we can run it via Docker in GOW but that’s not without its challenges. You need a physical monitor or a dummy plugged into your GPU (or some esoteric EDID trick which works only when also performing a human sacrifice). It doesn’t scale well with multiple remote clients when sharing a single host Ideally, can’t we just plug the shared video memory from the running App straight into Gstreamer ?? In theory, for a single fullscreen application that’s kind of possible (read until the end to get an idea of why it’s not so simple); but we need some way to compose multiple running windows into a single scene to be then encoded via the Gstreamer pipeline. Turns out that’s exactly what a Compositing window manager (or compositor) does, and since you can’t have just a compositor without the full X Window System (X11) running, we decided to follow the Wayland route. We are in a very fortunate position: we don’t even want to deal with real monitors, we just want to be the glue between an application running and the Gstreamer pipeline; for this reason we can have a simplified view (and implementation). Figure 1. A high level overview of the main components Let’s dive into each of these parts in isolation. The Wayland protocol does not include a rendering API. Instead, Wayland follows a direct rendering model, in which the client must render the window contents to a buffer shareable with the compositor. — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(protocol)#Rendering_model By removing the X server from the picture we also removed the mechanism by which X clients typically render, but there’s another mechanism: direct rendering. With direct rendering, the client and the server share a video memory buffer. The client links to a rendering library such as OpenGL that knows how to program the hardware and renders directly into the buffer. The compositor in turn can take the buffer and use it as a texture when it composites the desktop. One simple way to implement this buffer would be to use shm as a simple shared region between clients and the server. Most Wayland compositors do their rendering on the GPU, and many Wayland clients do their rendering on the GPU as well. With the shared memory approach, sending buffers from the client to the compositor in such cases is very inefficient, as the client has to read their data from the GPU to the CPU, then the compositor has to read it from the CPU back to the GPU to be rendered. The Linux DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) interface provides a means for us to export handles to GPU resources. Mesa, the predominant implementation of userspace Linux graphics drivers, implements a protocol that allows EGL users to transfer handles to their GPU buffers from the client to the compositor for rendering, without ever copying data to the GPU. Wayland is designed to update everything atomically, such that no frame is ever presented in an invalid or intermediate state. Our custom Wayland compositor knows where to get the rendered buffers, but it doesn’t know when the buffer is ready to be rendered; here’s where the Wayland protocol comes into play. Client surfaces will start in a pending state (and no state at all when first created), this state is negotiated over the course of any number of requests from clients and events from the server; when both sides agree that it’s a consistent surface, the surface is committed. Until this time, the compositor will continue to render the last consistent state. In Wayland, instead of continuously pushing new frames, you can let the compositor tell you when it’s ready for a new frame using frame callbacks. The compositor must finally compose the various surfaces into a single image, in order to do that efficiently we’ll also use EGL. Figure 2. The compositor communicates with the apps via the Wayland protocol, and compose surfaces via EGL Our compositor finally composed an image, and we are ready to send this to our Moonlight client, how do we push this to the selected encoder in the Gstreamer pipeline without copying? Sad news is, we don’t (at least currently). Although Gstreamer supports DMA Buffers (Direct Memory Access) which are an efficient way to share memory without going through the CPU, the support for modifiers of DMA Buffers is lacking behind significantly and varyies from one plugin to the next. What are modifiers? Modifiers add additional vendor specific properties to the internal pixel layout of a buffer. These modifiers are usually internally used by the GPU to speed up certain operations depending on characteristics of the hardware. None of this really has to worry us, because all of that is handled by the gpu driver. But because DMA buffers exist outside of the scope of a singular device, we need to carry the modifier of the buffer along. If it gets lost on the way, the program receiving the buffer has no idea how the data is layed out in memory and will likely output a broken image. Modifiers as such a crucial for communicating formats across devices, but they haven’t existed all the time. So called \"explicit\" modifiers are a relatively new addition to the apis in question. Previously the drivers managed modifiers internally without exposing them to the user. Buffers without an accompanying modifier are as such described as having an \"implicit\" modifier. Because the modifier is handled internally by the driver communication across devices is impossible with such a buffer. Because these changes are relatively new, a lot of software still has to adapt to the new explicit apis and many try to be able to handle both, implicit and explicit buffers. Gstreamer being composed of many plugins currently results in very different stages of transitioning between these apis. Some apis even got support for explicit modifiers, only to drop it a release later, because users of older plugins were complaining about incompatibilities…​ This means the chance of getting a good image out of the pipeline starting with a DMA Buffer is very small. Given the state of things, we are currently copying the buffer through host-memory once to side-step this issue for now. The plan for the future is to provide first an experimental option for using DMA buffers, and later with more testing and development we will hopefully be able to share, compose and finally encode different buffer types with zero memory copied between the GPU and the CPU for truely the best possible latency.

Moonlight will send a salt and client certificate, users will see a prompt asking to insert the password on the remote server. On the backend, we’ll need the PIN to be inserted by the user. PIN and SALT will be used to derive a shared AES key that needs to be stored in order to be used to decrypt in the next phases. At this stage we only have to send back our public certificate (plaincert). Using the AES key that we generated in the phase 1 we have to decrypt the client challenge, We generate a SHA256 hash with the following: Decrypted challenge Server certificate signature Server secret: a randomly generated secret The hash + server_challenge will then be AES encrypted and sent as the challengeresponse Moonlight will send back a serverchallengeresp: an AES encrypted client hash, we have to send back the pairingsecret: using our private key we have to sign the certificate_signature + server_secret (generated in phase 2) We now have to use everything we exchanged before in order to verify and finally pair the clients. We’ll check the client_hash obtained at phase 3, it should contain the following: The original server_challenge The signature of the X509 client_cert The unencrypted client_pairing_secret We’ll check that SHA256(server_challenge + client_public_cert_signature + client_secret) == client_hash Then using the client certificate public key we should be able to verify that the client secret has been signed by Moonlight The response will contain: paired = 1, if all checks are fine paired = 0, otherwise This extra step will run over HTTPS in order to make sure that Moonlight can reach Wolf over a secure connection.

RTSP messages are plaintext packets of variable size over TCP. Parsing of RTSP messages has been implemented using a formal PEG (Parsing Expression Grammars) definition; you can find it in parser.hpp. There are two types of message: request and response All messages have the following structure: message: required options: optional, zero or more key value options separated by newline payload: optional, extra unstructured data that needs to be passed. An example request message OPTIONS rtsp://192.168.1.100:48010 RTSP/1.0 (1) CSeq: 1 (2) X-GS-ClientVersion: 14 (3) (4) a=fmtp:97 surround-params=21101 (5) 1 message: 2 option 1 3 option 2 4 empty new line (end of options) 5 payload The message part is the first line, it’s delimited by the newline character (\\r\\n) , and it’s composed by: command: the first string, delimited by , the command to be executed on the backend; one of: [OPTIONS, DESCRIBE, SETUP, ANNOUNCE, PLAY] target: the second string, delimited by , specifies the ip address and port that is the target of the session. protocol: last string, delimited by , the RTSP protocol in use. Optional additional key values to be passed, delimited by the newline character (\\r\\n). The end of the options section is marked by an extra newline character (\\r\\n). Honorable mention goes to CSeq which is always present and represent the sequence number. Any extra unstructured text that it’s added after the end of the options before the end of the message will be parsed as the payload. Like requests, responses have a message, zero or more options and an optional payload. The main difference is in the format of the message. You can easily identify a response package by looking at the command part which is always RTSP. An example response message RTSP/1.0 200 OK (1) CSeq: 1 (2) a=fmtp:97 surround-params=21101 (3) 1 message 2 option 3 payload Unlike requests a message in a response is composed by different parts: protocol: it’s always RTSP/* and it’s the easiest way to discriminate between request and response messages. status code: follows the HTTP status codes specification status string: follows the HTTP status codes specification","title":"RTSP","component":"wolf","version":"dev-fake-uinput","name":"rtsp","url":"/wolf/dev-fake-uinput/protocols/rtsp.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"RTSP specifications","hash":"_rtsp_specifications","id":2},{"text":"Request message","hash":"_request_message","id":3},{"text":"Message","hash":"_message","id":4},{"text":"Options","hash":"_options","id":5},{"text":"Payload","hash":"_payload","id":6},{"text":"Response message","hash":"_response_message","id":7},{"text":"Message","hash":"_message_2","id":8}]},"15":{"id":15,"text":"Wolf is configured via a TOML config file and some additional optional ENV variables Variable Default Description WOLF_LOG_LEVEL INFO The log level to show, one of ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE WOLF_CFG_FILE /etc/wolf/cfg/config.toml Full path to the config file WOLF_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE /etc/wolf/cfg/key.pem Full path to the key.pem file WOLF_PRIVATE_CERT_FILE /etc/wolf/cfg/cert.pem Full path to the cert.pem file XDG_RUNTIME_DIR /tmp/sockets The full path where PulseAudio and video sockets will reside, this path is expected to be present in the host and mounted in the Wolf container WOLF_PULSE_IMAGE ghcr.io/games-on-whales/pulseaudio:master The name of the PulseAudio image to be started (when no connection is available) WOLF_STOP_CONTAINER_ON_EXIT TRUE Set to False in order to avoid force stop and removal of containers when the connection is closed WOLF_DOCKER_SOCKET /var/run/docker.sock The full path to the docker socket, doesn’t support tcp (yet) NVIDIA_DRIVER_VOLUME_NAME nvidia-driver-vol The name of the externally created Docker Volume that holds the Nvidia drivers HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER /etc/wolf The base folder in the host where the running apps will store permanent state WOLF_RENDER_NODE /dev/dri/renderD128 The default render node used for virtual desktops; see: Multiple GPUs WOLF_DOCKER_FAKE_UDEV_PATH $HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER/fake-udev The path on the host for the fake-udev CLI tool Additional env variables useful when debugging: Variable Default Description RUST_BACKTRACE full In case an exception is thrown in the Rust code, this sets the backtrace level GST_DEBUG 2 Gstreamer debug print, see debugging-tools Since Wolf supports multiple streaming sessions at the same time and each session can run a different app, we need to make sure that each app has its own folder where it can store permanent data. To achieve this, for each running app, Wolf will create a folder structure like this: ${HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER}/${app_state_folder}/${app_title} and then mount that as the home (/home/retro) for the docker container that will run the selected app. These 3 variables are defined as follows: HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER: defaults to /etc/wolf, can be changed via ENV app_state_folder: defaults to a unique identifier for each client so that every Moonlight session will have its own folder. Can be changed in the config.toml file app_title: the title of the app as defined in the config.toml file By default, Wolf will create a new home folder for each client, but if you want to share the same home folder with multiple clients, you can set the app_state_folder to the same value for each paired client; example: [[paired_clients]] app_state_folder = \"common\" # ../../../../bus/virtio/drivers/virtio_gpu (1) /sys/class/drm/renderD129/device/driver -> ../../../../bus/pci/drivers/nvidia (2) 1 This line will tell you that renderD128 is a virtual GPU 2 This line will tell you that renderD129 is a Nvidia GPU Wolf supports also overriding the render node in each single app defined in the config.toml config file by setting the render_node property; example: [apps.runner] type = \"docker\" name = \"WolfSteam\" image = \"ghcr.io/games-on-whales/steam:edge\" # More options here, removed for brevity... render_node = \"/dev/dri/renderD129\" In order to directly launch a Steam game from Moonlight you can just copy the existing entry for Steam, change the name and just add the Steam app ID as env variable; example: [[apps]] title = \"Elden Ring\" start_virtual_compositor = true [apps.runner] env = [ \"PROTON_LOG=1\", \"RUN_SWAY=true\", \"GOW_REQUIRED_DEVICES=/dev/input/* /dev/dri/* /dev/nvidia*\", \"STEAM_STARTUP_FLAGS=steam://rungameid/1245620\" ] # COPY EVERYTHING ELSE ...

Make sure that your driver version is >= 530.30.02 First, let’s build an additional docker image that will contain the Nvidia driver files: curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/games-on-whales/gow/master/images/nvidia-driver/Dockerfile | docker build -t gow/nvidia-driver:latest -f - --build-arg NV_VERSION=$(cat /sys/module/nvidia/version) . This will create gow/nvidia-driver:latest locally. Unfortunately, docker doesn’t seem to support directly mounting images, but you can pre-polulate volumes by running: docker create --rm --mount source=nvidia-driver-vol,destination=/usr/nvidia gow/nvidia-driver:latest sh It will create a Docker container, populate nvidia-driver-vol with Nvidia driver if it wasn’t already done and remove the container. Check volume exists with: docker volume ls | grep nvidia-driver local nvidia-driver-vol One last final check: we have to make sure that the nvidia-drm module has been loaded and that the module is loaded with the flag modeset=1. sudo cat /sys/module/nvidia_drm/parameters/modeset Y I get N or the file is not present, how do I set the flag? If using Grub, the easiest way to make the change persistent is to add nvidia-drm.modeset=1 to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line in /etc/default/grub ex: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet nvidia-drm.modeset=1\" Then sudo update-grub and reboot.

KERNEL==\"uinput\", SUBSYSTEM==\"misc\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", OPTIONS+=\"static_node=uinput\" Allows Wolf to access /dev/uinput on your system.

SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{id/vendor}==\"ab00\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", ENV{ID_SEAT}=\"seat9\" This line checks for the custom vendor-id that Wolf gives to newly created virtual devices and assigns them to seat9, which will cause any session with a lower seat (usually you only have seat1 for your main session) to ignore the devices.

The assigned name instead is specific to Wolf. You can’t assign controllers a seat however (well - you can - but it won’t have the same effect), so we just give it permissions where only user+group can pick it up.

This is done by editing the config.toml file. To create a bind mount for your ROMs, add the following line to the \"HostConfig\" section of your config.toml: \"Binds\": [ \"/path/to/roms:/ROMs\" ] Replace /path/to/roms with the actual path to your ROM directory on the host system.

This gives us the power to support multiple concurrent users effortlessly. Code can easily be re-used by other projects since every part is highly decoupled. Enables testing most of the implemented methods in isolation. We are also trying to isolate the Moonlight protocol from the actual implementation so that we can create a portable C++ library of stateless methods, where possible, the code has been separated in logical modules. High-level utilities and re-usable libraries, not strictly tied to Moonlight or Wolf: docker.hpp: using libcurl and boost json to interrogate the Docker socket and provide an easy to use interface to most methods. input.hpp: an easy to use virtual input device library; supports mouse, keyboard, joypads and more! virtual-display.hpp: a simple abstraction on top of games-on-whales/gst-wayland-display in order to create and control virtual desktops. audio.hpp: a simple abstraction on top of libpulse to create and control virtual audio devices.

A working example: connecting a joypad to the client triggers the right detection in RetroArch running in the server. Wolf creates virtual devices on-demand based on the packets that are received from Moonlight clients over the control stream. When a new virtual device is created, we have to \"mount\" it inside the right running Docker container since, in order to achieve isolation, we can’t run them with the privileged flag. Normally, Docker assigns devices available to a container at creation time. Fortunately, it supports a more permissive rule that allows to access a wider range of devices based on the device major:minor. By adding the --device-cgroup-rule we can then call mknod [1] from inside the container in order to mount the virtual devices on-demand from the outside. Example Docker command issued by Wolf docker exec -it sh -c \"mknod /dev/input/ c :\" We’ve mounted the right device into the right container, still, no application is picking it up [2]. We have to trigger some kind of \"event\" in order to advertise that a new device has arrived, turns out those kind of events are generated by udev. An example udev event when you plug a joypad UDEV [3588.199301] add /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.3/0000:02:00.0/usb1/1-1/1-1:1.3/0003:054C:0CE6.0007/input/input20/js0 (input) ACTION=add SUBSYSTEM=input DEVNAME=/dev/input/js0 ID_BUS=usb ID_MODEL=Wireless_Controller ID_SERIAL=Sony_Interactive_Entertainment_Wireless_Controller ID_VENDOR=Sony_Interactive_Entertainment ID_VENDOR_ENC=Sony\\x20Interactive\\x20Entertainment ID_VENDOR_ID=054c ID_REVISION=0100 ID_TYPE=hid ID_USB_VENDOR_ID=054c ID_USB_REVISION=0100 ID_USB_TYPE=hid ID_USB_DRIVER=usbhid MAJOR=13 MINOR=0 The first approach is to just pass the udev socket (and db files, more on this later) from the host. Sure, every application will get the event that a new device has been plugged, so this kind of defeats isolation; but since we are mounting only in one container, this should still work, right? Unfortunately, there’s another issue: when Wolf creates a new virtual device, it will in turn automatically trigger the udev event to be \"broadcast\" to every listening application and if this happens before we are able to mknod the device it’ll result in an application that can’t access the device that we’ve created. We want to be able to be in control of exactly when these events will be sent so that the flow is as follows: Figure 2. The order here matters, the udev events must be sent after the mount Since we have no control over udev and we can’t mount a device before it’s created we have to replicate the events that are generated by it and broadcast them in the same way to all listening applications. First, let’s take a step back; how are application communicating with udev? Though udev runs in userspace, it is highly entangled with the Linux kernel. The first entry that recognizes device insertion/deletion events is surely the Linux kernel. While there were no mechanisms for the Linux kernel to push notifications to userspace processes (with ioctl() the kernel can only provide responses for the corresponding requests from userspace processes), netlink IPC mechanism emerged and currently it is available for the kernel to send a notification first. — https://insujang.github.io/2018-11-27/udev-device-manager-for-the-linux-kernel-in-userspace/ Normally udevd does the following steps: Listens for kernel events via the netlink socket (GROUP_KERNEL) When it receives a new device event, it’ll run all the rules that are defined Send back the \"augmented\" message via another netlink socket (GROUP_UDEV) The two different groups are crucial, whilst every user application can listen the GROUP_KERNEL events only the kernel can be the origin for those messages. GROUP_UDEV being an user space group instead can be \"impersonated\" by any user space application [3]. Since this will run in Docker there’s an additional mechanism that we have to keep in mind: network namespaces. Since udevd communicates via netlink a container that doesn’t run with --network=host will not receive those events; we’ll have to run our custom udev sender inside the container network namespace in order to achieve full isolation. There are 3 main components that needs to be \"faked\" in order for tricking programs that are using libudev into using our fake events: create a file under /run/udev/control this is not used for anything else apart from detection that udev is present AFAIU. send a valid NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT event via netlink using GROUP_UDEV generate the appropriate DB entries in /run/udev/data/ these are just plain text files where the filename is just c: and the content is roughly the same as the event message payload The result of all this is our little CLI utility called fake-udev which we’ll install into our containers and call with our custom-generated events after mknod. echo -ne \\\"ACTION=add\\\\0DEVNAME=input/bomb\\\\0DEVPATH=/devices/bomb\\\\0SEQNUM=1234\\\\0SUBSYSTEM=input\\\\0\\\" | base64 | sudo fake-udev # `udevadm monitor` should print something like: UDEV [3931.403835] add /devices/bomb (input) These steps will finally achieve proper hotplug detection by the applications that are running inside a Docker container without exposing any udev event/file from the host filesystem. Luckily, reversing the steps is enough to also correctly unplug devices. First off, a huge thanks goes to John McDonough for all the help in figuring most of this stuff out and for leading the way with his prototype JohnCMcDonough/virtual-gamepad. 1. This obviously requires also the MKNOD capability to be enabled (--cap-add MKNOD) 2. Some application might react to the new device if it’s using inotify, unfortunately, this is not the default behaviour in most apps/games 3.

The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing. — gstreamer.freedesktop.org We implemented two custom plugins (one for video and one for audio) in order to turn a stream of bytes into a stream of valid Moonlight RTP packets. This allows users to be able to compose Gstreamer pipelines in any form or shape and, near the end, plug our plugin so that it can be streamed to Moonlight. Figure 1. Our plugin sits between the encoded bitestream and a downstream UDP sink that will send the RTP packets to Moonlight The basic flow is the following: The plugin receives a GstBuffer of binary data: the encoded video or audio stream into a format that can be decoded back by the Moonlight client. We’ll split this into a GstBufferList of valid RTP packets following the Moonlight specifications; this includes: split the original buffer into a set of correctly sized chunks Encrypt the chunks when enabled add RTP headers to each chunk create additional RTP packets with the FEC information Push the resulting list downstream Figure 2. An example pipeline for video encoding and streaming Figure 3. An example pipeline for audio encoding and streaming This flow is general enough to enable us to use the same plugin for H.264, HEVC and AV1 (and any other encoder that will be supported in future). Downstream, it’s also trivial to switch between UDP/TCP or even a complete different delivery method if needed. We decided to split between audio and video because they have different RTP packet structure, non overlapping properties, different FEC encoding and different encryption requirements but the basic flow is the same for both plugins. Given that this is a direct transformation from one input buffer to another output buffer we decided to use GstBaseTransform as the base class. This will implement some boilerplate code for us so that we can focus on the main _transform virtual method implementation. Following the nomenclature used in the official GStreamer RTP plugins we called them rtpmoonlightpay_video and rtpmoonlightpay_audio as in RTP Moonlight Payloader video/audio. GStreamer uses GObjects: a mechanism to retrofit Objects into C. I suggest you to get a bit familiar with it before diving into the code; here’s a great and simple tutorial. Following the official docs at Plugin Write’s Guide we started off with the official bash script that creates the boilerplate code from the selected base class; namely: gstrtpmoonlightpay_video.hpp and gstrtpmoonlightpay_video.cpp contain all the boilerplate code needed to setup a plugin, property definitions, etc. gstrtpmoonlightpay_audio.hpp and gstrtpmoonlightpay_audio.cpp for audio. video.hpp contains all the functions that turns a linear buffer of data into a list of correctly formed RTP packets. audio.hpp same for audio","title":"GStreamer","component":"wolf","version":"dev-nix","name":"gstreamer","url":"/wolf/dev-nix/dev/gstreamer.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"The plugin","hash":"_the_plugin","id":2},{"text":"Code","hash":"_code","id":3}]},"27":{"id":27,"text":"Wolf is composed of a few independent components that, when used together, allow us to run and stream multiple graphical applications on the same server without any overlap between them. In order to create virtual desktops on-demand, we’ve created a custom (micro) Wayland compositor: gst-wayland-display. It’s based on Smithay, coded in Rust and exposes both a standalone GStreamer plugin and an easy-to-use C API. The main benefit of this solution is that our compositor will then expose the raw framebuffer so that Wolf can feed that directly to the video encoding pipeline. You can read more about it in Headless Wayland. To keep things simple, our Wayland compositor doesn’t support XWayland, for containers that need it (like Steam) we use Gamescope which can be run as a Wayland client, and it’ll provide XWayland support to the downstream app. Audio doesn’t need any HW acceleration, it’s fairly trivial to run PulseAudio as a standalone container and use libpulse in order to create virtual audio sink on-demand. Creating and managing virtual devices is handled by inputtino: a small library that abstracts away the complexities of managing uinput (and uhid) to create virtual input devices. Virtual devices created by inputtino will be visible on the host system and can potentially break the host isolation that we’re trying to achieve. In order to avoid this, we encourage users to install a set of udev rules that will restrict access to these devices to a specific group (e.g. input) and move mouse and keyboard to a different seat (see user:quickstart.adoc#_virtual_devices_support). You can read a more detailed explanation into why we’ve added uhid and how gyro/acceleration is achieved here Some devices like mouse and keyboard are always present and will be automatically created and setup before starting the application. Other devices can be hotplugged whilst the streaming is running; for example, a gamepad can be plugged in after the game has started. Special care is needed in order to safely mount these new devices in the app container and to make them available to the running application, there’s an in-depth article about it here: Hotplug in Docker We run applications in a containerised environment, this way we can ensure that the application will not interfere with the host system (and with other running apps) and that it will have access only to the virtual devices that we’ve created. We have a set of pre-built containers that are optimised to work with our flow in games-on-whales/gow. Generally, though, most of the GUI applications should work inside a container that can then be streamed via Wolf. We use GStreamer to encode the video and audio streams and send them to the client. We have automatic support for HW acceleration using CUDA, QuickSync and VAAPI but thanks to GStreamer we can easily add more encoders into the mix, without having to write a single line of code! The full encoding pipeline is described in a string that can be overridden by users just by changing the config.toml file. We’ve implemented a couple of custom GStreamer plugins in order to properly split, RTP encode and add FEC to the resulting buffers into the format that Moonlight expects; they live in here: src/moonlight-server/gst-plugin.","title":"How does it work?","component":"wolf","version":"dev-nix","name":"how-it-works","url":"/wolf/dev-nix/dev/how-it-works.html","titles":[{"text":"Virtual desktop","hash":"_virtual_desktop","id":1},{"text":"Virtual audio","hash":"_virtual_audio","id":2},{"text":"Virtual input devices","hash":"_virtual_input_devices","id":3},{"text":"Support hotplug via fake-udev","hash":"_support_hotplug_via_fake_udev","id":4},{"text":"Running applications/games","hash":"_running_applicationsgames","id":5},{"text":"Streaming","hash":"_streaming","id":6}]},"28":{"id":28,"text":"We provide a devcontainer configuration that will allow you to automatically setup a development environment for Wolf.

You can just use ximagesrc and hook your host X11 desktop to the stream but there are some issues with that: Xorg has to be up and running; we can run it via Docker in GOW but that’s not without its challenges. You need a physical monitor or a dummy plugged into your GPU (or some esoteric EDID trick which works only when also performing a human sacrifice). It doesn’t scale well with multiple remote clients when sharing a single host Ideally, can’t we just plug the shared video memory from the running App straight into Gstreamer ?? In theory, for a single fullscreen application that’s kind of possible (read until the end to get an idea of why it’s not so simple); but we need some way to compose multiple running windows into a single scene to be then encoded via the Gstreamer pipeline. Turns out that’s exactly what a Compositing window manager (or compositor) does, and since you can’t have just a compositor without the full X Window System (X11) running, we decided to follow the Wayland route. We are in a very fortunate position: we don’t even want to deal with real monitors, we just want to be the glue between an application running and the Gstreamer pipeline; for this reason we can have a simplified view (and implementation). Figure 1. A high level overview of the main components Let’s dive into each of these parts in isolation. The Wayland protocol does not include a rendering API. Instead, Wayland follows a direct rendering model, in which the client must render the window contents to a buffer shareable with the compositor. — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(protocol)#Rendering_model By removing the X server from the picture we also removed the mechanism by which X clients typically render, but there’s another mechanism: direct rendering. With direct rendering, the client and the server share a video memory buffer. The client links to a rendering library such as OpenGL that knows how to program the hardware and renders directly into the buffer. The compositor in turn can take the buffer and use it as a texture when it composites the desktop. One simple way to implement this buffer would be to use shm as a simple shared region between clients and the server. Most Wayland compositors do their rendering on the GPU, and many Wayland clients do their rendering on the GPU as well. With the shared memory approach, sending buffers from the client to the compositor in such cases is very inefficient, as the client has to read their data from the GPU to the CPU, then the compositor has to read it from the CPU back to the GPU to be rendered. The Linux DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) interface provides a means for us to export handles to GPU resources. Mesa, the predominant implementation of userspace Linux graphics drivers, implements a protocol that allows EGL users to transfer handles to their GPU buffers from the client to the compositor for rendering, without ever copying data to the GPU. Wayland is designed to update everything atomically, such that no frame is ever presented in an invalid or intermediate state. Our custom Wayland compositor knows where to get the rendered buffers, but it doesn’t know when the buffer is ready to be rendered; here’s where the Wayland protocol comes into play. Client surfaces will start in a pending state (and no state at all when first created), this state is negotiated over the course of any number of requests from clients and events from the server; when both sides agree that it’s a consistent surface, the surface is committed. Until this time, the compositor will continue to render the last consistent state. In Wayland, instead of continuously pushing new frames, you can let the compositor tell you when it’s ready for a new frame using frame callbacks. The compositor must finally compose the various surfaces into a single image, in order to do that efficiently we’ll also use EGL. Figure 2. The compositor communicates with the apps via the Wayland protocol, and compose surfaces via EGL Our compositor finally composed an image, and we are ready to send this to our Moonlight client, how do we push this to the selected encoder in the Gstreamer pipeline without copying? Sad news is, we don’t (at least currently). Although Gstreamer supports DMA Buffers (Direct Memory Access) which are an efficient way to share memory without going through the CPU, the support for modifiers of DMA Buffers is lacking behind significantly and varyies from one plugin to the next. What are modifiers? Modifiers add additional vendor specific properties to the internal pixel layout of a buffer. These modifiers are usually internally used by the GPU to speed up certain operations depending on characteristics of the hardware. None of this really has to worry us, because all of that is handled by the gpu driver. But because DMA buffers exist outside of the scope of a singular device, we need to carry the modifier of the buffer along. If it gets lost on the way, the program receiving the buffer has no idea how the data is layed out in memory and will likely output a broken image. Modifiers as such a crucial for communicating formats across devices, but they haven’t existed all the time. So called \"explicit\" modifiers are a relatively new addition to the apis in question. Previously the drivers managed modifiers internally without exposing them to the user. Buffers without an accompanying modifier are as such described as having an \"implicit\" modifier. Because the modifier is handled internally by the driver communication across devices is impossible with such a buffer. Because these changes are relatively new, a lot of software still has to adapt to the new explicit apis and many try to be able to handle both, implicit and explicit buffers. Gstreamer being composed of many plugins currently results in very different stages of transitioning between these apis. Some apis even got support for explicit modifiers, only to drop it a release later, because users of older plugins were complaining about incompatibilities…​ This means the chance of getting a good image out of the pipeline starting with a DMA Buffer is very small. Given the state of things, we are currently copying the buffer through host-memory once to side-step this issue for now. The plan for the future is to provide first an experimental option for using DMA buffers, and later with more testing and development we will hopefully be able to share, compose and finally encode different buffer types with zero memory copied between the GPU and the CPU for truely the best possible latency.

In order to debug what’s exchanged it might be useful to checkout the RFC 6716 #section-3.1 which defines the Opus packet formats; from the specs: A well-formed Opus packet MUST contain at least one byte [R1]. This byte forms a table-of-contents (TOC) header that signals which of the various modes and configurations a given packet uses. It is composed of a configuration number, \"config\", a stereo flag, \"s\", and a frame count code, \"c\" Figure 3. The first byte of any Opus packet Encoded audio packets will be AES encrypted before being sent over the wire, key and IV are exchanged via HTTPS when calling the launch endpoint. These are the same key and IV used to also encrypt the Control stream. Uses Reed Solomon to encode the payload so that it can be checked on the receiving end for transmission errors (and possibly fix them). This operation will create extra parity blocks that will be sent in separate RTP packets.","title":"Audio stream via RTP","component":"wolf","version":"dev-nix","name":"rtp-opus","url":"/wolf/dev-nix/protocols/rtp-opus.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"PING","hash":"_ping","id":2},{"text":"RTP packets","hash":"_rtp_packets","id":3},{"text":"Opus encoder","hash":"_opus_encoder","id":4},{"text":"AES encryption","hash":"_aes_encryption","id":5},{"text":"Forward Error Correction (FEC)","hash":"_forward_error_correction_fec","id":6}]},"35":{"id":35,"text":"Here are a few random notes about the low level details of the video streaming protocol in Moonlight. The port exchanged during the RTSP phase it’s not where the actual video stream will take place! Moonlight will send a PING package to the exchanged port, this will tell us which random port the connecting client was able to open in order to communicate with Wolf. The client port from where Wolf receives the PING will also be the one where the actual RTP stream will be sent to. This is necessary because usually clients will be behind NAT. The video binary NAL unit (see below) will be separated in chunks of packetSize (default: 1024, exchanged during RTSP) + RTP_HEADER_SIZE (16 byte). The first 32 bytes of each packet are defined as follows: Figure 1. RTP header format in bits Figure 2. NV Video header format in bits The very first packet of the sequence will also contain the hardcoded 017charss string before the actual video payload What does this content mean? Figure 3.

Uses Reed Solomon to encode the payload so that it can be checked on the receiving end for transmission errors (and possibly fix them). This operation will create extra parity blocks that will be sent in separate RTP packets. The size of this can be set by changing the fecpercentage param. With a video payload of 4KB, a packetSize of 1024 and a fecpercentage of 50%: 4 RTP packets will contain the video data 2 extra RTP packets will be sent with the FEC parity information The total overhead of sending 4KB of video will be: headers * packets + FEC = 32 * 6 + 2048 = 2248 bytes This extra packets can be easily identified since the NV Video flag will always be 0.

RTSP messages are plaintext packets of variable size over TCP. Parsing of RTSP messages has been implemented using a formal PEG (Parsing Expression Grammars) definition; you can find it in parser.hpp. There are two types of message: request and response All messages have the following structure: message: required options: optional, zero or more key value options separated by newline payload: optional, extra unstructured data that needs to be passed. An example request message OPTIONS rtsp://192.168.1.100:48010 RTSP/1.0 (1) CSeq: 1 (2) X-GS-ClientVersion: 14 (3) (4) a=fmtp:97 surround-params=21101 (5) 1 message: 2 option 1 3 option 2 4 empty new line (end of options) 5 payload The message part is the first line, it’s delimited by the newline character (\\r\\n) , and it’s composed by: command: the first string, delimited by , the command to be executed on the backend; one of: [OPTIONS, DESCRIBE, SETUP, ANNOUNCE, PLAY] target: the second string, delimited by , specifies the ip address and port that is the target of the session. protocol: last string, delimited by , the RTSP protocol in use. Optional additional key values to be passed, delimited by the newline character (\\r\\n). The end of the options section is marked by an extra newline character (\\r\\n). Honorable mention goes to CSeq which is always present and represent the sequence number. Any extra unstructured text that it’s added after the end of the options before the end of the message will be parsed as the payload. Like requests, responses have a message, zero or more options and an optional payload. The main difference is in the format of the message. You can easily identify a response package by looking at the command part which is always RTSP. An example response message RTSP/1.0 200 OK (1) CSeq: 1 (2) a=fmtp:97 surround-params=21101 (3) 1 message 2 option 3 payload Unlike requests a message in a response is composed by different parts: protocol: it’s always RTSP/* and it’s the easiest way to discriminate between request and response messages. status code: follows the HTTP status codes specification status string: follows the HTTP status codes specification","title":"RTSP","component":"wolf","version":"dev-nix","name":"rtsp","url":"/wolf/dev-nix/protocols/rtsp.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"RTSP specifications","hash":"_rtsp_specifications","id":2},{"text":"Request message","hash":"_request_message","id":3},{"text":"Message","hash":"_message","id":4},{"text":"Options","hash":"_options","id":5},{"text":"Payload","hash":"_payload","id":6},{"text":"Response message","hash":"_response_message","id":7},{"text":"Message","hash":"_message_2","id":8}]},"37":{"id":37,"text":"Wolf is configured via a TOML config file and some additional optional ENV variables Variable Default Description WOLF_LOG_LEVEL INFO The log level to show, one of ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE WOLF_CFG_FILE /etc/wolf/cfg/config.toml Full path to the config file WOLF_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE /etc/wolf/cfg/key.pem Full path to the key.pem file WOLF_PRIVATE_CERT_FILE /etc/wolf/cfg/cert.pem Full path to the cert.pem file XDG_RUNTIME_DIR /tmp/sockets The full path where PulseAudio and video sockets will reside, this path is expected to be present in the host and mounted in the Wolf container WOLF_PULSE_IMAGE ghcr.io/games-on-whales/pulseaudio:master The name of the PulseAudio image to be started (when no connection is available) WOLF_STOP_CONTAINER_ON_EXIT TRUE Set to False in order to avoid force stop and removal of containers when the connection is closed WOLF_DOCKER_SOCKET /var/run/docker.sock The full path to the docker socket, doesn’t support tcp (yet) NVIDIA_DRIVER_VOLUME_NAME nvidia-driver-vol The name of the externally created Docker Volume that holds the Nvidia drivers HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER /etc/wolf The base folder in the host where the running apps will store permanent state WOLF_RENDER_NODE /dev/dri/renderD128 The default render node used for virtual desktops; see: Multiple GPUs WOLF_ENCODER_NODE $WOLF_RENDER_NODE The default render node used for the Gstreamer pipelines; see: Multiple GPUs WOLF_DOCKER_FAKE_UDEV_PATH $HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER/fake-udev The path on the host for the fake-udev CLI tool Additional env variables useful when debugging: Variable Default Description RUST_BACKTRACE full In case an exception is thrown in the Rust code, this sets the backtrace level GST_DEBUG 2 Gstreamer debug print, see debugging-tools Since Wolf supports multiple streaming sessions at the same time and each session can run a different app, we need to make sure that each app has its own folder where it can store permanent data. To achieve this, for each running app, Wolf will create a folder structure like this: ${HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER}/${app_state_folder}/${app_title} and then mount that as the home (/home/retro) for the docker container that will run the selected app. These 3 variables are defined as follows: HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER: defaults to /etc/wolf, can be changed via ENV app_state_folder: defaults to a unique identifier for each client so that every Moonlight session will have its own folder. Can be changed in the config.toml file app_title: the title of the app as defined in the config.toml file This will break isolation, if you want to connect with multiple clients at the same time you should not share the home folder. You can follow development of that feature here By default, Wolf will create a new home folder for each client, but if you want to share the same home folder with multiple clients, you can set the app_state_folder to the same value for each paired client; example: [[paired_clients]] app_state_folder = \"common\" # ../../../../bus/virtio/drivers/virtio_gpu (1) /sys/class/drm/renderD129/device/driver -> ../../../../bus/pci/drivers/nvidia (2) 1 This line will tell you that renderD128 is a virtual GPU 2 This line will tell you that renderD129 is a Nvidia GPU Wolf supports also overriding the render node in each single app defined in the config.toml config file by setting the render_node property; example: [apps.runner] type = \"docker\" name = \"WolfSteam\" image = \"ghcr.io/games-on-whales/steam:edge\" # More options here, removed for brevity... render_node = \"/dev/dri/renderD129\" The easy way to control this is to just edit the env variable WOLF_ENCODER_NODE (defaults to match WOLF_RENDER_NODE in order to use the same GPU for both), this will set the default render node used for the Gstreamer pipelines. The streaming video encoding pipeline is fully controlled by the config.toml file; here the order in which entries are listed is important because Wolf will just try each listed plugin; the first one that works is the one that will be used. If you have an Intel iGPU and a Nvidia card in the same host, and you would like to use QuickSync in order to do the encoding, you can either: Delete the nvcodec entries under gstreamer.video.hevc_encoders Cut the qsv entry and paste it above the nvcodec entry On top of that, each single apps entry support overriding the default streaming pipeline; for example: [[apps]] title = \"Test ball\" # More options here, removed for brevity... [apps.video] source = \"\"\" videotestsrc pattern=ball flip=true is-live=true ! video/x-raw, framerate={fps}/1 \\ \"\"\" In case you have two GPUs that will use the same encoder pipeline (example: an AMD iGPU and an AMD GPU card) you can override the video_params with the corresponding encoder plugin; see: gstreamer/issues/1167. This has been moved to the steam.adoc page. This guide demonstrates how to change the default keyboard layout and switch between multiple layouts in Docker containers. For Layout and Variant codes see: https://man.archlinux.org/man/xkeyboard-config.7#LAYOUTS Add environment variable XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT= and XKB_DEFAULT_VARIANT= to [apps.runner] config. Keyboard layout environment variable example [apps.runner] env = [ # ... \"XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT=fr\", \"XKB_DEFAULT_VARIANT=azerty\", ] Using configuration file allow more layouts to be configured. Note: configuration file is only supported for Sway compositor and won’t have any effect wih Gamescope. Create a config file at ${HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER}/cfg/90-custom.conf with the following content: input type:keyboard { xkb_layout \"fr,us\" xkb_numlock \"enable\" } xkb_layout : The first layout code you set will be the default layout. Add other layouts separated by commas. xkb_numlock \"enable\" turns on NumLock by default. In the same folder, edit ${HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER}/cfg/config.toml For each container where you want to use the custom layout, edit the \"mounts\" variable as follows: mounts = [ \"${HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER}/cfg/90-custom.conf:/etc/sway/config.d/90-custom.conf\", ] This ensures that the config is not overwritten. On the next app restart, the keyboard layout will be set to the default one specified. Start the console in Moonlight. Use the command: swaymsg input type:keyboard xkb_switch_layout next In Steam, add a \"Non-Steam Game\", and select anything as the target. Once the game is created in Steam, Right-click on it and select \"Properties\". In the \"Target\" field, enter: /bin/bash -c \"swaymsg input type:keyboard xkb_switch_layout next\" Rename the game to \"Switch Layout\". Close the properties window. You now have a clickable link in Steam to switch layouts.","title":"Configuration","component":"wolf","version":"dev-nix","name":"configuration","url":"/wolf/dev-nix/user/configuration.html","titles":[{"text":"ENV variables","hash":"_env_variables","id":1},{"text":"Where apps will store permanent data?","hash":"data_setup","id":2},{"text":"Share home folder with multiple clients","hash":"_share_home_folder_with_multiple_clients","id":3},{"text":"Change the HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER","hash":"_change_the_host_apps_state_folder","id":4},{"text":"TOML file","hash":"_toml_file","id":5},{"text":"Defining apps","hash":"_defining_apps","id":6},{"text":"Override the default joypad mapping","hash":"_override_the_default_joypad_mapping","id":7},{"text":"Input mouse overrides","hash":"_input_mouse_overrides","id":8},{"text":"App Runner","hash":"_app_runner","id":9},{"text":"Process","hash":"_process","id":10},{"text":"Docker","hash":"_docker","id":11},{"text":"Gstreamer","hash":"_gstreamer","id":12},{"text":"CO-OP sessions","hash":"_co_op_sessions","id":13},{"text":"Set Window compositor","hash":"_set_window_compositor","id":14},{"text":"Multiple GPUs","hash":"_multiple_gpu","id":15},{"text":"App render node","hash":"_app_render_node","id":16},{"text":"Gstreamer video encoding","hash":"_gstreamer_video_encoding","id":17},{"text":"Directly launch a Steam game","hash":"_directly_launch_a_steam_game","id":18},{"text":"Changing and Switching Keyboard Layouts in wolf Apps Containers","hash":"_changing_and_switching_keyboard_layouts_in_wolf_apps_containers","id":19},{"text":"Using environment variable","hash":"_using_environment_variable","id":20},{"text":"Using configuration file","hash":"_using_configuration_file","id":21},{"text":"Create a Configuration File","hash":"_create_a_configuration_file","id":22},{"text":"Configure Container Mounts","hash":"_configure_container_mounts","id":23},{"text":"Switching Layouts","hash":"_switching_layouts","id":24},{"text":"Switching layout from the console in moonlight","hash":"_switching_layout_from_the_console_in_moonlight","id":25},{"text":"Creating a Steam Shortcut for Layout Switching","hash":"_creating_a_steam_shortcut_for_layout_switching","id":26}]},"38":{"id":38,"text":"To list the installed plugins use: gst-inspect-1.0 To analyse some media use: gst-discoverer-1.0 -v https://storage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4 To test out pipelines in your system use: gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc !

Unfortunately, on Nvidia, things are a little bit more complex.. Make sure that your driver version is >= 530.30.02 First, let’s build an additional docker image that will contain the Nvidia driver files: curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/games-on-whales/gow/master/images/nvidia-driver/Dockerfile | docker build -t gow/nvidia-driver:latest -f - --build-arg NV_VERSION=$(cat /sys/module/nvidia/version) . This will create gow/nvidia-driver:latest locally. Unfortunately, docker doesn’t seem to support directly mounting images, but you can pre-polulate volumes by running: docker create --rm --mount source=nvidia-driver-vol,destination=/usr/nvidia gow/nvidia-driver:latest sh It will create a Docker container, populate nvidia-driver-vol with Nvidia driver if it wasn’t already done and remove the container. Check volume exists with: docker volume ls | grep nvidia-driver local nvidia-driver-vol One last final check: we have to make sure that the nvidia-drm module has been loaded and that the module is loaded with the flag modeset=1. sudo cat /sys/module/nvidia_drm/parameters/modeset Y I get N or the file is not present, how do I set the flag?

First, create a new file nvidia.conf in the /etc/modules-load.d/ directory and open it with a text editor. nano /etc/modules-load.d/nvidia.conf paste the following content to the file: nvidia nvidia_uvm For the changes to take effect, update the initramfs file with the following command: update-initramfs -u Add udev rules to add missing Nvidia devices nano /etc/udev/rules.d/70-nvidia.rules paste the following content to the file: # create necessary NVIDIA device files in /dev/* KERNEL==\"nvidia\", RUN+=\"/bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/nvidia-smi -L && /bin/chmod 0666 /dev/nvidia*'\" KERNEL==\"nvidia_uvm\", RUN+=\"/bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/nvidia-modprobe -c0 -u && /bin/chmod 0666 /dev/nvidia-uvm*'\" reboot you host and try running ls -l /dev/nvidia* again. Running Wolf in WSL2 hasn’t been properly tested. You can run Wolf in a very unprivileged setting without uinput/uhid, unfortunately this means that you’ll be restricted to only using mouse and keyboard. For Nvidia users, follow the Nvidia instructions above. This should work for AMD/Intel users. docker run \\ --name wolf \\ --network=host \\ -e XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/sockets \\ -v /tmp/sockets:/tmp/sockets:rw \\ -e HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER=/etc/wolf \\ -v /etc/wolf:/etc/wolf:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ --device /dev/dri/ \\ ghcr.io/games-on-whales/wolf:stable At the moment it is only possible to run Wolf inside a privileged LXC. First you need to make sure your GPU drivers are installed and loaded on your PVE host. Also make sure to add the virtual devices udev rules to the PVE host as explained in the Virtual devices support section. Now, we need to edit LXC config file to passtrough the GPU. I don’t have a LXC yet The easiest way to create an LXC to run Wolf is to use tteck’s PVE docker script, this will create you a LXC with docker already good to go. (Make sure you choose privileged LXC and install docker-compose when prompted) Enter the LXC config file: nano /etc/pve/lxc/1XX.conf it should look similar to this: arch: amd64 cores: 8 features: nesting=1 hostname: wolf memory: 8192 net0: name=eth0,bridge=vmbr0,hwaddr=BC:24:11:B7:90:5D,ip=dhcp,type=veth onboot: 1 ostype: debian rootfs: local-lvm:vm-118-disk-0,size=128G swap: 512 tags: proxmox-helper-scripts lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: a lxc.cap.drop: lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 188:* rwm lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 189:* rwm lxc.mount.entry: /dev/serial/by-id dev/serial/by-id none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyUSB0 dev/ttyUSB0 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyUSB1 dev/ttyUSB1 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyACM0 dev/ttyACM0 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyACM1 dev/ttyACM1 none bind,optional,create=file remove the following lines from the bottom, they are not needed: lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 188:* rwm lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 189:* rwm lxc.mount.entry: /dev/serial/by-id dev/serial/by-id none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyUSB0 dev/ttyUSB0 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyUSB1 dev/ttyUSB1 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyACM0 dev/ttyACM0 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyACM1 dev/ttyACM1 none bind,optional,create=file add these lines to the bottom of the file: For Nvidia dev0: /dev/uinput dev1: /dev/uhid dev2: /dev/nvidia0 dev3: /dev/nvidiactl dev4: /dev/nvidia-modeset dev5: /dev/nvidia-uvm dev6: /dev/nvidia-uvm-tools dev7: /dev/nvidia-caps/nvidia-cap1 dev8: /dev/nvidia-caps/nvidia-cap2 lxc.mount.entry: /dev/dri dev/dri none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /dev/input dev/input none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /run/udev mnt/udev none bind,optional,create=dir For Intel/AMD dev0: /dev/uinput dev1: /dev/uhid lxc.mount.entry: /dev/dri dev/dri none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /dev/input dev/input none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /run/udev mnt/udev none bind,optional,create=dir save the file, exit, and restart your LXC. Your LXC is good to go, complete the installation based on the GPU following the other tabs. When creating your docker-compose.yml don’t forget to modify the volume mapping for /run/udev path, as we mounted it on /mnt/udev inside our LXC volumes: - /mnt/udev:/run/udev:rw And if you have a multi GPU setup, don’t forget to set the below env variable environment: - WOLF_RENDER_NODE=/dev/dri/renderD12X Which ports are used by Wolf? To keep things simple the scripts above defaulted to network:host; that’s not really required, the minimum set of ports that needs to be exposed are: # HTTPS EXPOSE 47984/tcp # HTTP EXPOSE 47989/tcp # Control EXPOSE 47999/udp # RTSP EXPOSE 48010/tcp # Video (up to 10 users, you can open more ports if needed) EXPOSE 48100-48110/udp # Audio (up to 10 users, you can open more ports if needed) EXPOSE 48200-48210/udp You should now be able to point Moonlight to the IP address of the server and start the pairing process: In Moonlight, you’ll get a prompt for a PIN Wolf will log a line with a link to a page where you can input that PIN (ex: http://localhost:47989/pin/#337327E8A6FC0C66 make sure to replace localhost with your server IP) In Moonlight, you should now be able to see a list of the applications that are supported by Wolf If you can only see a black screen with a cursor in Moonlight it’s because the first time that you start an app Wolf will download the corresponding docker image + first time updates. Keep an eye on the logs from Wolf to get more details. We use uinput to create virtual devices (Mouse, Keyboard and Joypad), make sure that /dev/uinput is present in the host: ls -la /dev/uinput crw------- 1 root root 10, 223 Jan 17 09:08 /dev/uinput Add your user to group input sudo usermod -a -G input $USER Create udev rules under /etc/udev/rules.d/85-wolf-virtual-inputs.rules # Allows Wolf to acces /dev/uinput KERNEL==\"uinput\", SUBSYSTEM==\"misc\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", OPTIONS+=\"static_node=uinput\" # Allows Wolf to access /dev/uhid KERNEL==\"uhid\", TAG+=\"uaccess\" # Move virtual keyboard and mouse into a different seat SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{id/vendor}==\"ab00\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", ENV{ID_SEAT}=\"seat9\" # Joypads SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf X-Box One (virtual) pad\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf PS5 (virtual) pad\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf gamepad (virtual) motion sensors\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf Nintendo (virtual) pad\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" What does that mean? KERNEL==\"uinput\", SUBSYSTEM==\"misc\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", OPTIONS+=\"static_node=uinput\" Allows Wolf to access /dev/uinput on your system. It needs that node to create the virtual devices. This is usually not the default on servers, but if that is already working for you on your desktop system, you can skip this line. SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{id/vendor}==\"ab00\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", ENV{ID_SEAT}=\"seat9\" This line checks for the custom vendor-id that Wolf gives to newly created virtual devices and assigns them to seat9, which will cause any session with a lower seat (usually you only have seat1 for your main session) to ignore the devices. SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf X-Box One (virtual) pad\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf PS5 (virtual) pad\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf gamepad (virtual) motion sensors\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf Nintendo (virtual) pad\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" Now the virtual controllers are different, because we need to emulate an existing brand for them to be picked up correctly, so our virtual controllers have a vendor/product id resembling a real controller. The assigned name instead is specific to Wolf. You can’t assign controllers a seat however (well - you can - but it won’t have the same effect), so we just give it permissions where only user+group can pick it up.

If it’s the very first time that you are running an app, and you can only see a black screen with a cursor in Moonlight, it’s probably because Wolf is downloading the corresponding docker image and installing first time updates (when necessary). If this persists or Moonlight kicks you out of the streaming session then you should probably take a look at the Wolf logs to gather more informations.

Wolf is an open source streaming server for Moonlight that allows you to share a single server with multiple remote clients in order to play videogames! It’s made from the ground up with the following primary goals: Allow multiple users to stream different content by sharing a single remote host hardware On demand creation of virtual desktops with full support for any resolution/FPS without the need for a monitor or a dummy plug. Allow multiple GPUs to be used simultaneously for different jobs Example: stream encoding on iGPU whilst gaming on GPU Provide low latency video and audio stream with full support for gamepads Linux and Docker first: run your games with low privileges in containers (based on Games On Whales) Mostly hackable, just edit the config file to modify encoding pipelines, GPU settings or Docker/Podman low level details It’s a specific tool for a specific need, are you looking for a general purpose streaming solution?

We (try to) follow a functional programming paradigm where all the methods take immutable inputs and returns new outputs; this has great benefits: Given the highly parallel nature of Wolf, we can easily share immutable data structures to multiple threads without having to deal with race conditions. This gives us the power to support multiple concurrent users effortlessly. Code can easily be re-used by other projects since every part is highly decoupled. Enables testing most of the implemented methods in isolation. We are also trying to isolate the Moonlight protocol from the actual implementation so that we can create a portable C++ library of stateless methods, where possible, the code has been separated in logical modules. High-level utilities and re-usable libraries, not strictly tied to Moonlight or Wolf: docker.hpp: using libcurl and boost json to interrogate the Docker socket and provide an easy to use interface to most methods. input.hpp: an easy to use virtual input device library; supports mouse, keyboard, joypads and more! virtual-display.hpp: a simple abstraction on top of games-on-whales/gst-wayland-display in order to create and control virtual desktops. audio.hpp: virtual audio library A little CLI tool that enables us to generate udev events. You can read more about the rationale behind it in Hotplug in Docker. Here we define core Moonlight functions in order to create the foundation for a platform-agnostic portable library. It currently hosts the followings: HTTP/S protocol interface: protocol.hpp Control protocol packet format control.hpp Reed Solomon FEC header fec.hpp Based on top of sleepybishop/nanors RTSP message parser parser.hpp Built using yhirose/cpp-peglib by writing a formal PEG (Parsing Expression Grammars) definition for all messages This is where the final Wolf executable will be built, contains all the additional code and logic required to run the full Moonlight server. Unit tests will live under tests/ and are written using the Catch2 framework.

A working example: connecting a joypad to the client triggers the right detection in RetroArch running in the server. Wolf creates virtual devices on-demand based on the packets that are received from Moonlight clients over the control stream. When a new virtual device is created, we have to \"mount\" it inside the right running Docker container since, in order to achieve isolation, we can’t run them with the privileged flag. Normally, Docker assigns devices available to a container at creation time. Fortunately, it supports a more permissive rule that allows to access a wider range of devices based on the device major:minor. By adding the --device-cgroup-rule we can then call mknod [1] from inside the container in order to mount the virtual devices on-demand from the outside. Example Docker command issued by Wolf docker exec -it sh -c \"mknod /dev/input/ c :\" We’ve mounted the right device into the right container, still, no application is picking it up [2]. We have to trigger some kind of \"event\" in order to advertise that a new device has arrived, turns out those kind of events are generated by udev. An example udev event when you plug a joypad UDEV [3588.199301] add /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.3/0000:02:00.0/usb1/1-1/1-1:1.3/0003:054C:0CE6.0007/input/input20/js0 (input) ACTION=add SUBSYSTEM=input DEVNAME=/dev/input/js0 ID_BUS=usb ID_MODEL=Wireless_Controller ID_SERIAL=Sony_Interactive_Entertainment_Wireless_Controller ID_VENDOR=Sony_Interactive_Entertainment ID_VENDOR_ENC=Sony\\x20Interactive\\x20Entertainment ID_VENDOR_ID=054c ID_REVISION=0100 ID_TYPE=hid ID_USB_VENDOR_ID=054c ID_USB_REVISION=0100 ID_USB_TYPE=hid ID_USB_DRIVER=usbhid MAJOR=13 MINOR=0 The first approach is to just pass the udev socket (and db files, more on this later) from the host. Sure, every application will get the event that a new device has been plugged, so this kind of defeats isolation; but since we are mounting only in one container, this should still work, right? Unfortunately, there’s another issue: when Wolf creates a new virtual device, it will in turn automatically trigger the udev event to be \"broadcast\" to every listening application and if this happens before we are able to mknod the device it’ll result in an application that can’t access the device that we’ve created. We want to be able to be in control of exactly when these events will be sent so that the flow is as follows: Figure 2. The order here matters, the udev events must be sent after the mount Since we have no control over udev and we can’t mount a device before it’s created we have to replicate the events that are generated by it and broadcast them in the same way to all listening applications. First, let’s take a step back; how are application communicating with udev? Though udev runs in userspace, it is highly entangled with the Linux kernel. The first entry that recognizes device insertion/deletion events is surely the Linux kernel. While there were no mechanisms for the Linux kernel to push notifications to userspace processes (with ioctl() the kernel can only provide responses for the corresponding requests from userspace processes), netlink IPC mechanism emerged and currently it is available for the kernel to send a notification first. — https://insujang.github.io/2018-11-27/udev-device-manager-for-the-linux-kernel-in-userspace/ Normally udevd does the following steps: Listens for kernel events via the netlink socket (GROUP_KERNEL) When it receives a new device event, it’ll run all the rules that are defined Send back the \"augmented\" message via another netlink socket (GROUP_UDEV) The two different groups are crucial, whilst every user application can listen the GROUP_KERNEL events only the kernel can be the origin for those messages. GROUP_UDEV being an user space group instead can be \"impersonated\" by any user space application [3]. Since this will run in Docker there’s an additional mechanism that we have to keep in mind: network namespaces. Since udevd communicates via netlink a container that doesn’t run with --network=host will not receive those events; we’ll have to run our custom udev sender inside the container network namespace in order to achieve full isolation. There are 3 main components that needs to be \"faked\" in order for tricking programs that are using libudev into using our fake events: create a file under /run/udev/control this is not used for anything else apart from detection that udev is present AFAIU. send a valid NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT event via netlink using GROUP_UDEV generate the appropriate DB entries in /run/udev/data/ these are just plain text files where the filename is just c: and the content is roughly the same as the event message payload The result of all this is our little CLI utility called fake-udev which we’ll install into our containers and call with our custom-generated events after mknod. echo -ne \\\"ACTION=add\\\\0DEVNAME=input/bomb\\\\0DEVPATH=/devices/bomb\\\\0SEQNUM=1234\\\\0SUBSYSTEM=input\\\\0\\\" | base64 | sudo fake-udev # `udevadm monitor` should print something like: UDEV [3931.403835] add /devices/bomb (input) These steps will finally achieve proper hotplug detection by the applications that are running inside a Docker container without exposing any udev event/file from the host filesystem. Luckily, reversing the steps is enough to also correctly unplug devices. First off, a huge thanks goes to John McDonough for all the help in figuring most of this stuff out and for leading the way with his prototype JohnCMcDonough/virtual-gamepad. 1. This obviously requires also the MKNOD capability to be enabled (--cap-add MKNOD) 2. Some application might react to the new device if it’s using inotify, unfortunately, this is not the default behaviour in most apps/games 3.

The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing. — gstreamer.freedesktop.org We implemented two custom plugins (one for video and one for audio) in order to turn a stream of bytes into a stream of valid Moonlight RTP packets. This allows users to be able to compose Gstreamer pipelines in any form or shape and, near the end, plug our plugin so that it can be streamed to Moonlight. Figure 1. Our plugin sits between the encoded bitestream and a downstream UDP sink that will send the RTP packets to Moonlight The basic flow is the following: The plugin receives a GstBuffer of binary data: the encoded video or audio stream into a format that can be decoded back by the Moonlight client. We’ll split this into a GstBufferList of valid RTP packets following the Moonlight specifications; this includes: split the original buffer into a set of correctly sized chunks Encrypt the chunks when enabled add RTP headers to each chunk create additional RTP packets with the FEC information Push the resulting list downstream Figure 2. An example pipeline for video encoding and streaming Figure 3. An example pipeline for audio encoding and streaming This flow is general enough to enable us to use the same plugin for H.264, HEVC and AV1 (and any other encoder that will be supported in future). Downstream, it’s also trivial to switch between UDP/TCP or even a complete different delivery method if needed. We decided to split between audio and video because they have different RTP packet structure, non overlapping properties, different FEC encoding and different encryption requirements but the basic flow is the same for both plugins. Given that this is a direct transformation from one input buffer to another output buffer we decided to use GstBaseTransform as the base class. This will implement some boilerplate code for us so that we can focus on the main _transform virtual method implementation. Following the nomenclature used in the official GStreamer RTP plugins we called them rtpmoonlightpay_video and rtpmoonlightpay_audio as in RTP Moonlight Payloader video/audio. GStreamer uses GObjects: a mechanism to retrofit Objects into C. I suggest you to get a bit familiar with it before diving into the code; here’s a great and simple tutorial. Following the official docs at Plugin Write’s Guide we started off with the official bash script that creates the boilerplate code from the selected base class; namely: gstrtpmoonlightpay_video.hpp and gstrtpmoonlightpay_video.cpp contain all the boilerplate code needed to setup a plugin, property definitions, etc. gstrtpmoonlightpay_audio.hpp and gstrtpmoonlightpay_audio.cpp for audio. video.hpp contains all the functions that turns a linear buffer of data into a list of correctly formed RTP packets. audio.hpp same for audio","title":"GStreamer","component":"wolf","version":"dev-tracy","name":"gstreamer","url":"/wolf/dev-tracy/dev/gstreamer.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"The plugin","hash":"_the_plugin","id":2},{"text":"Code","hash":"_code","id":3}]},"45":{"id":45,"text":"This has been tested on Debian 12, you should adjust the setup based on your distro of choice.

You can just use ximagesrc and hook your host X11 desktop to the stream but there are some issues with that: Xorg has to be up and running; we can run it via Docker in GOW but that’s not without its challenges. You need a physical monitor or a dummy plugged into your GPU (or some esoteric EDID trick which works only when also performing a human sacrifice). It doesn’t scale well with multiple remote clients when sharing a single host Ideally, can’t we just plug the shared video memory from the running App straight into Gstreamer ?? In theory, for a single fullscreen application that’s kind of possible (read until the end to get an idea of why it’s not so simple); but we need some way to compose multiple running windows into a single scene to be then encoded via the Gstreamer pipeline. Turns out that’s exactly what a Compositing window manager (or compositor) does, and since you can’t have just a compositor without the full X Window System (X11) running, we decided to follow the Wayland route. We are in a very fortunate position: we don’t even want to deal with real monitors, we just want to be the glue between an application running and the Gstreamer pipeline; for this reason we can have a simplified view (and implementation). Figure 1. A high level overview of the main components Let’s dive into each of these parts in isolation. The Wayland protocol does not include a rendering API. Instead, Wayland follows a direct rendering model, in which the client must render the window contents to a buffer shareable with the compositor. — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(protocol)#Rendering_model By removing the X server from the picture we also removed the mechanism by which X clients typically render, but there’s another mechanism: direct rendering. With direct rendering, the client and the server share a video memory buffer. The client links to a rendering library such as OpenGL that knows how to program the hardware and renders directly into the buffer. The compositor in turn can take the buffer and use it as a texture when it composites the desktop. One simple way to implement this buffer would be to use shm as a simple shared region between clients and the server. Most Wayland compositors do their rendering on the GPU, and many Wayland clients do their rendering on the GPU as well. With the shared memory approach, sending buffers from the client to the compositor in such cases is very inefficient, as the client has to read their data from the GPU to the CPU, then the compositor has to read it from the CPU back to the GPU to be rendered. The Linux DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) interface provides a means for us to export handles to GPU resources. Mesa, the predominant implementation of userspace Linux graphics drivers, implements a protocol that allows EGL users to transfer handles to their GPU buffers from the client to the compositor for rendering, without ever copying data to the GPU. Wayland is designed to update everything atomically, such that no frame is ever presented in an invalid or intermediate state. Our custom Wayland compositor knows where to get the rendered buffers, but it doesn’t know when the buffer is ready to be rendered; here’s where the Wayland protocol comes into play. Client surfaces will start in a pending state (and no state at all when first created), this state is negotiated over the course of any number of requests from clients and events from the server; when both sides agree that it’s a consistent surface, the surface is committed. Until this time, the compositor will continue to render the last consistent state. In Wayland, instead of continuously pushing new frames, you can let the compositor tell you when it’s ready for a new frame using frame callbacks. The compositor must finally compose the various surfaces into a single image, in order to do that efficiently we’ll also use EGL. Figure 2. The compositor communicates with the apps via the Wayland protocol, and compose surfaces via EGL Our compositor finally composed an image, and we are ready to send this to our Moonlight client, how do we push this to the selected encoder in the Gstreamer pipeline without copying? Sad news is, we don’t (at least currently). Although Gstreamer supports DMA Buffers (Direct Memory Access) which are an efficient way to share memory without going through the CPU, the support for modifiers of DMA Buffers is lacking behind significantly and varyies from one plugin to the next. What are modifiers? Modifiers add additional vendor specific properties to the internal pixel layout of a buffer. These modifiers are usually internally used by the GPU to speed up certain operations depending on characteristics of the hardware. None of this really has to worry us, because all of that is handled by the gpu driver. But because DMA buffers exist outside of the scope of a singular device, we need to carry the modifier of the buffer along. If it gets lost on the way, the program receiving the buffer has no idea how the data is layed out in memory and will likely output a broken image. Modifiers as such a crucial for communicating formats across devices, but they haven’t existed all the time. So called \"explicit\" modifiers are a relatively new addition to the apis in question. Previously the drivers managed modifiers internally without exposing them to the user. Buffers without an accompanying modifier are as such described as having an \"implicit\" modifier. Because the modifier is handled internally by the driver communication across devices is impossible with such a buffer. Because these changes are relatively new, a lot of software still has to adapt to the new explicit apis and many try to be able to handle both, implicit and explicit buffers. Gstreamer being composed of many plugins currently results in very different stages of transitioning between these apis. Some apis even got support for explicit modifiers, only to drop it a release later, because users of older plugins were complaining about incompatibilities…​ This means the chance of getting a good image out of the pipeline starting with a DMA Buffer is very small. Given the state of things, we are currently copying the buffer through host-memory once to side-step this issue for now. The plan for the future is to provide first an experimental option for using DMA buffers, and later with more testing and development we will hopefully be able to share, compose and finally encode different buffer types with zero memory copied between the GPU and the CPU for truely the best possible latency.

RTSP messages are plaintext packets of variable size over TCP. Parsing of RTSP messages has been implemented using a formal PEG (Parsing Expression Grammars) definition; you can find it in parser.hpp. There are two types of message: request and response All messages have the following structure: message: required options: optional, zero or more key value options separated by newline payload: optional, extra unstructured data that needs to be passed. An example request message OPTIONS rtsp://192.168.1.100:48010 RTSP/1.0 (1) CSeq: 1 (2) X-GS-ClientVersion: 14 (3) (4) a=fmtp:97 surround-params=21101 (5) 1 message: 2 option 1 3 option 2 4 empty new line (end of options) 5 payload The message part is the first line, it’s delimited by the newline character (\\r\\n) , and it’s composed by: command: the first string, delimited by , the command to be executed on the backend; one of: [OPTIONS, DESCRIBE, SETUP, ANNOUNCE, PLAY] target: the second string, delimited by , specifies the ip address and port that is the target of the session. protocol: last string, delimited by , the RTSP protocol in use. Optional additional key values to be passed, delimited by the newline character (\\r\\n). The end of the options section is marked by an extra newline character (\\r\\n). Honorable mention goes to CSeq which is always present and represent the sequence number. Any extra unstructured text that it’s added after the end of the options before the end of the message will be parsed as the payload. Like requests, responses have a message, zero or more options and an optional payload. The main difference is in the format of the message. You can easily identify a response package by looking at the command part which is always RTSP. An example response message RTSP/1.0 200 OK (1) CSeq: 1 (2) a=fmtp:97 surround-params=21101 (3) 1 message 2 option 3 payload Unlike requests a message in a response is composed by different parts: protocol: it’s always RTSP/* and it’s the easiest way to discriminate between request and response messages. status code: follows the HTTP status codes specification status string: follows the HTTP status codes specification","title":"RTSP","component":"wolf","version":"dev-tracy","name":"rtsp","url":"/wolf/dev-tracy/protocols/rtsp.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"RTSP specifications","hash":"_rtsp_specifications","id":2},{"text":"Request message","hash":"_request_message","id":3},{"text":"Message","hash":"_message","id":4},{"text":"Options","hash":"_options","id":5},{"text":"Payload","hash":"_payload","id":6},{"text":"Response message","hash":"_response_message","id":7},{"text":"Message","hash":"_message_2","id":8}]},"54":{"id":54,"text":"Wolf is configured via a TOML config file and some additional optional ENV variables Variable Default Description WOLF_LOG_LEVEL INFO The log level to show, one of ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE WOLF_CFG_FILE /etc/wolf/cfg/config.toml Full path to the config file WOLF_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE /etc/wolf/cfg/key.pem Full path to the key.pem file WOLF_PRIVATE_CERT_FILE /etc/wolf/cfg/cert.pem Full path to the cert.pem file XDG_RUNTIME_DIR /tmp/sockets The full path where PulseAudio and video sockets will reside, this path is expected to be present in the host and mounted in the Wolf container WOLF_PULSE_IMAGE ghcr.io/games-on-whales/pulseaudio:master The name of the PulseAudio image to be started (when no connection is available) WOLF_STOP_CONTAINER_ON_EXIT TRUE Set to False in order to avoid force stop and removal of containers when the connection is closed WOLF_DOCKER_SOCKET /var/run/docker.sock The full path to the docker socket, doesn’t support tcp (yet) NVIDIA_DRIVER_VOLUME_NAME nvidia-driver-vol The name of the externally created Docker Volume that holds the Nvidia drivers HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER /etc/wolf The base folder in the host where the running apps will store permanent state WOLF_RENDER_NODE /dev/dri/renderD128 The default render node used for virtual desktops; see: Multiple GPUs WOLF_DOCKER_FAKE_UDEV_PATH $HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER/fake-udev The path on the host for the fake-udev CLI tool Additional env variables useful when debugging: Variable Default Description RUST_BACKTRACE full In case an exception is thrown in the Rust code, this sets the backtrace level GST_DEBUG 2 Gstreamer debug print, see debugging-tools The TOML configuration file is read only once at startup (or created if not present) and it’ll be modified by Wolf only when a new user is successfully paired.

There are currently two types of runner supported: docker and process Example: [apps.runner] type = \"process\" run_cmd = \"sh -c \\\"while :; do echo 'running...'; sleep 10; done\\\"\" Example: type = \"docker\" name = \"WolfSteam\" image = \"ghcr.io/games-on-whales/steam:edge\" mounts = [ \"/run/udev:/run/udev:ro\" ] env = [ \"PROTON_LOG=1\", \"RUN_GAMESCOPE=true\", \"ENABLE_VKBASALT=1\" ] devices = [] ports = [] base_create_json = \"\"\" (1) { \"HostConfig\": { \"IpcMode\": \"host\", \"CapAdd\": [\"SYS_ADMIN\", \"SYS_NICE\"], \"Privileged\": false } } \\ \"\"\" 1 base_create_json: here you can re-define any property that’s defined in the docker API JSON format, see: docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.40 In here we define the default pipeline for both video and audio streaming to Moonlight. In order to automatically pick up the right encoder at runtime based on the user HW we run in order the list of encoders at gstreamer.video.hevc_encoders (and gstreamer.video.h264_encoders); the first set of plugins that can be correctly initialised by Gstreamer will be the selected encoder for all the pipelines. You can read more about gstreamer and custom pipelines in the Gstreamer page. When you have multiple GPUs installed in your host, you might want to have better control over which one is used by Wolf and how. There are two main separated parts that make use of HW acceleration in Wolf: Gstreamer video encoding: this will use HW acceleration in order to efficiently encode the video stream with H.264 or HEVC. App render node: this will use HW acceleration in order to create virtual Wayland desktops and run the chosen app (ex: Firefox, Steam, …​) They can be configured separately, and ideally you could even use two GPUs at the same time for different jobs; a common setup would be to use the integrated GPU just for the streaming part and use a powerful GPU to play apps/games. The streaming video encoding pipeline is fully controlled by the config.toml file; here the order in which entries are listed is important because Wolf will just try each listed plugin; the first one that works is the one that will be used. If you have an Intel iGPU and a Nvidia card in the same host, and you would like to use QuickSync in order to do the encoding, you can either: Delete the nvcodec entries under gstreamer.video.hevc_encoders Cut the qsv entry and paste it above the nvcodec entry On top of that, each single apps entry support overriding the default streaming pipeline; for example: [[apps]] title = \"Test ball\" # More options here, removed for brevity... [apps.video] source = \"\"\" videotestsrc pattern=ball flip=true is-live=true ! video/x-raw, framerate={fps}/1 \\ \"\"\" In case you have two GPUs that will use the same encoder pipeline (example: an AMD iGPU and an AMD GPU card) you can override the encoder_pipeline with the corresponding encoder plugin; see: gstreamer/issues/1167. Each application that Wolf will start will have access only to a specific render node even if the host has multiple GPUs connected. By default, Wolf will use the env variable WOLF_RENDER_NODE which defaults to /dev/dri/renderD128 If you don’t know which render node is associated with which GPU you can use the following command: ls -l /sys/class/drm/renderD*/device/driver /sys/class/drm/renderD128/device/driver -> ../../../../bus/virtio/drivers/virtio_gpu (1) /sys/class/drm/renderD129/device/driver -> ../../../../bus/pci/drivers/nvidia (2) 1 This line will tell you that renderD128 is a virtual GPU 2 This line will tell you that renderD129 is a Nvidia GPU Wolf supports also overriding the render node in each single app defined in the config.toml config file by setting the render_node property; example: [apps.runner] type = \"docker\" name = \"WolfSteam\" image = \"ghcr.io/games-on-whales/steam:edge\" # More options here, removed for brevity... render_node = \"/dev/dri/renderD129\"","title":"Configuration","component":"wolf","version":"dev-tracy","name":"configuration","url":"/wolf/dev-tracy/user/configuration.html","titles":[{"text":"ENV variables","hash":"_env_variables","id":1},{"text":"TOML file","hash":"_toml_file","id":2},{"text":"Defining apps","hash":"_defining_apps","id":3},{"text":"App Runner","hash":"_app_runner","id":4},{"text":"Process","hash":"_process","id":5},{"text":"Docker","hash":"_docker","id":6},{"text":"Gstreamer","hash":"_gstreamer","id":7},{"text":"Multiple GPUs","hash":"_multiple_gpu","id":8},{"text":"Gstreamer video encoding","hash":"_gstreamer_video_encoding","id":9},{"text":"App render node","hash":"_app_render_node","id":10}]},"55":{"id":55,"text":"To list the installed plugins use: gst-inspect-1.0 To analyse some media use: gst-discoverer-1.0 -v https://storage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4 To test out pipelines in your system use: gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! autovideosink See more examples at: matthew1000/gstreamer-cheat-sheet [[apps]] title = \"Desktop\" [apps.video] source = \"avfvideosrc capture-screen-cursor=true capture-screen=true\" This works in OSX, for X11 you can use ximagesrc or on Wayland you can try: pipewiresrc Here the trick is to use shmsink and shmsrc in order to share the raw audio between the video and audio pipeline: [[apps]] title = \"Music\" # Audio sample downloaded from https://www.bensound.com/free-music-for-videos # try also: spacescope style=color-lines [apps.video] source = \"\"\" filesrc location=/Users/ale/Downloads/elevate.mp3 ! tee name=t ! queue ! shmsink socket-path=/tmp/pipe.sock shm-size=10000000 t. ! decodebin ! audioconvert ! wavescope style=color-lines \"\"\" # Get the audio info using: # gst-discoverer-1.0 -v elevate.mp3 [apps.audio] source = \"\"\" shmsrc socket-path=/tmp/pipe.sock do-timestamp=true ! audio/mpeg, mpegversion=(int)1, mpegaudioversion=(int)1, layer=(int)3, rate=(int)44100, channels=(int)2 ! decodebin \"\"\" Here the trick is to use shmsink and shmsrc in order to share the raw audio between the video and audio pipeline: [[apps]] title = \"BigBuckBunny (MP4 - remote)\" [apps.video] # taken from https://gist.github.com/jsturgis/3b19447b304616f18657 source = \"\"\" curlhttpsrc location=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4\" ! qtdemux name=demux demux.audio_0 ! queue ! shmsink socket-path=/tmp/pipe.sock shm-size=10000000 demux.video_0 ! decodebin \\ \"\"\" # Get the audio info using: # gst-discoverer-1.0 -v https://storage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4 [apps.audio] source = \"\"\" shmsrc socket-path=/tmp/pipe.sock do-timestamp=true ! audio/mpeg, mpegversion=(int)4, framed=(boolean)true, stream-format=(string)raw, level=(string)2, base-profile=(string)lc, profile=(string)lc, codec_data=(buffer)1210, rate=(int)44100, channels=(int)2 ! decodebin \"\"\" Here the trick is to use shmsink and shmsrc in order to share the raw audio between the video and audio pipeline: [[apps]] title = \"Twitch.tv\" [apps.video] # location is the result of # youtube-dl --format mp4 --get-url https://www.twitch.tv/videos/560738950 source = \"\"\" curlhttpsrc location=\"https://dqrpb9wgowsf5.cloudfront.net/49e35d90a96078583c9c_andrewfoxtv_34248972186_2596839032/chunked/highlight-560738950.m3u8\" ! hlsdemux ! tsdemux name=demux demux.audio_0_0100 ! queue ! shmsink socket-path=/tmp/pipe.sock shm-size=10000000 demux.video_0_0101 ! queue ! decodebin \\ \"\"\" # Get the audio info using: # gst-discoverer-1.0 -v https://dqrpb9wgowsf5.cloudfront.net/49e35d90a96078583c9c_andrewfoxtv_34248972186_2596839032/chunked/highlight-560738950.m3u8 [apps.audio] source = \"\"\" shmsrc socket-path=/tmp/pipe.sock do-timestamp=true ! audio/mpeg, framed=(boolean)true, mpegversion=(int)4, level=(string)2, base-profile=(string)lc, profile=(string)lc, rate=(int)44100, channels=(int)2, stream-format=(string)adts ! decodebin \"\"\" The element compositor allows video to be mixed (overlayed, put side-by-side, etc).

Check volume exists with: docker volume ls | grep nvidia-driver local nvidia-driver-vol One last final check: we have to make sure that the nvidia-drm module has been loaded and that the module is loaded with the flag modeset=1. sudo cat /sys/module/nvidia_drm/parameters/modeset Y I get N or the file is not present, how do I set the flag?

KERNEL==\"uinput\", SUBSYSTEM==\"misc\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", OPTIONS+=\"static_node=uinput\" Allows Wolf to access /dev/uinput on your system.

Once the container is launched, Wolf streams the output to the connected Moonlight client. Currently, when opening and closing the app through Moonlight, the app container will be deleted. Therefore, all data except for the mounted paths will be deleted, which ensures application consistency to some extent. However, if modifications to the container are needed, such as installing additional software, the best approach is to create a custom app image. Wolf uses the same app image as in the GoW project. Therefore, you can refer to this link for customizing app content. See each subpage for further details and additional configuration steps. If you want to build your own app, you can use the following template: Clone the GOW repo git clone https://github.com/games-on-whales/gow.git All the published images are in the images/ directory. You can edit any of the images or create a new one. For example, say that you want to add another emulator to ES-DE: Edit the images/es-de/Dockerfile file and add the necessary software. Build the image: open a shell in the root of the GOW repo, then use Docker to build with the following command: This will build the image locally with the tag gow/es-de:custom. docker build -t gow/es-de:custom --build-arg BASE_APP_IMAGE=ghcr.io/games-on-whales/base-app:edge images/es-de . Finally, update the config.toml file in Wolf to use the new image. Just change the image field under [apps.runner] to the newly locally built gow/es-de:custom. Don’t forget to contribute back by creating a pull request in games-on-whales/gow! I want to edit something in base or base-app Our builds are hierarchical: all images are based on base-app which is based on base. You can build them with: docker build -t gow/base images/base . docker build -t gow/base-app --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=gow/base images/base-app . If you have a desktop environment running on your host, you can run the built image without even using Wolf. Here’s an example of running Steam inside Docker on a Wayland host without installing anything else on your host: docker run --name=steam --rm -it \\ --device=/dev/dri/renderD128 \\ --device=/dev/dri/card0 \\ --ipc=host \\ --cap-add=ALL \\ --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \\ -e XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp \\ -v ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/${WAYLAND_DISPLAY}:/tmp/${WAYLAND_DISPLAY}:rw \\ -e XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland \\ -e WAYLAND_DISPLAY=${WAYLAND_DISPLAY} \\ -e RUN_SWAY=true \\ -v /tmp/SteamGOWData:/home/retro/ \\ ghcr.io/games-on-whales/steam:edge Figure 1. The Steam big picture mode should start on your host in a normal window Depending on your host setup, you might need to adjust this command. For example, for Nvidia users with the container toolkit installed you might need to add --gpus=all instead of --device=/dev/dri/renderD128 --device=/dev/dri/card0 and -e NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all to the environment variables. In the command above /tmp/SteamGOWData in your host is where the home folder (containing Steam client and settings in this example) will be stored, make sure to adjust that to your liking.","title":"Apps","component":"wolf","version":"dev-wolfapi","name":"index","url":"/wolf/dev-wolfapi/apps/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Build your own","hash":"_build_your_own","id":2},{"text":"Example: edit an already existing image","hash":"_example_edit_an_already_existing_image","id":3},{"text":"Testing out an image locally","hash":"_testing_out_an_image_locally","id":4}]},"61":{"id":61,"text":"Table of Contents Introduction Getting Started ROM Directory Structure Setting Up ROM Directories Configuration Setting Up Bind Mounts for ROMs Example Configuration Emulators Customization Theming Troubleshooting and Additional Resources Pegasus is a powerful and flexible frontend for launching games, similar to EmulationStation.

By default, Pegasus is configured to look for ROMs in the /ROMs directory, with subdirectories for each platform. You can either create the ROM directories in the format below or edit Pegasus to use your preferred location. /ROMs/3do /ROMs/amiga /ROMs/amigacd32 /ROMs/arcade /ROMs/atari2600 /ROMs/atari5200 /ROMs/atari7800 /ROMs/atarijaguar /ROMs/atarijaguarcd /ROMs/atarilynx /ROMs/atarist /ROMs/gb /ROMs/gba /ROMs/gbc /ROMs/gc /ROMs/genesis /ROMs/megacd /ROMs/model2 /ROMs/model3 /ROMs/n64 /ROMs/naomi /ROMs/neogeo /ROMs/nes /ROMs/ngp /ROMs/ngpc /ROMs/ps2 /ROMs/ps3 /ROMs/psp /ROMs/psx /ROMs/saturn /ROMs/sega32x /ROMs/segacd /ROMs/snes /ROMs/snes_widescreen /ROMs/switch /ROMs/virtualboy /ROMs/wii /ROMs/wiiu /ROMs/wonderswan /ROMs/wonderswancolor /ROMs/xbox To make your roms accessible to Pegasus within the container, you need to create a bind mount that maps your host ROM folder to the /ROMs directory in the container. This is done by editing the config.toml file. To create a bind mount for your ROMs, add the following line to the \"HostConfig\" section of your config.toml: \"Binds\": [ \"/path/to/roms:/ROMs\" ] Replace /path/to/roms with the actual path to your ROM directory on the host system.

We (try to) follow a functional programming paradigm where all the methods take immutable inputs and returns new outputs; this has great benefits: Given the highly parallel nature of Wolf, we can easily share immutable data structures to multiple threads without having to deal with race conditions. This gives us the power to support multiple concurrent users effortlessly. Code can easily be re-used by other projects since every part is highly decoupled. Enables testing most of the implemented methods in isolation. We are also trying to isolate the Moonlight protocol from the actual implementation so that we can create a portable C++ library of stateless methods, where possible, the code has been separated in logical modules. High-level utilities and re-usable libraries, not strictly tied to Moonlight or Wolf: docker.hpp: using libcurl and boost json to interrogate the Docker socket and provide an easy to use interface to most methods. input.hpp: an easy to use virtual input device library; supports mouse, keyboard, joypads and more! virtual-display.hpp: a simple abstraction on top of games-on-whales/gst-wayland-display in order to create and control virtual desktops. audio.hpp: a simple abstraction on top of libpulse to create and control virtual audio devices.

Unit tests will live under tests/ and are written using the Catch2 framework. We are implementing unit tests for most of the methods and (where possible) also mocking packets/requests seen during real Moonlight sessions.

A working example: connecting a joypad to the client triggers the right detection in RetroArch running in the server. Wolf creates virtual devices on-demand based on the packets that are received from Moonlight clients over the control stream. When a new virtual device is created, we have to \"mount\" it inside the right running Docker container since, in order to achieve isolation, we can’t run them with the privileged flag. Normally, Docker assigns devices available to a container at creation time. Fortunately, it supports a more permissive rule that allows to access a wider range of devices based on the device major:minor. By adding the --device-cgroup-rule we can then call mknod [1] from inside the container in order to mount the virtual devices on-demand from the outside. Example Docker command issued by Wolf docker exec -it sh -c \"mknod /dev/input/ c :\" We’ve mounted the right device into the right container, still, no application is picking it up [2]. We have to trigger some kind of \"event\" in order to advertise that a new device has arrived, turns out those kind of events are generated by udev. An example udev event when you plug a joypad UDEV [3588.199301] add /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.3/0000:02:00.0/usb1/1-1/1-1:1.3/0003:054C:0CE6.0007/input/input20/js0 (input) ACTION=add SUBSYSTEM=input DEVNAME=/dev/input/js0 ID_BUS=usb ID_MODEL=Wireless_Controller ID_SERIAL=Sony_Interactive_Entertainment_Wireless_Controller ID_VENDOR=Sony_Interactive_Entertainment ID_VENDOR_ENC=Sony\\x20Interactive\\x20Entertainment ID_VENDOR_ID=054c ID_REVISION=0100 ID_TYPE=hid ID_USB_VENDOR_ID=054c ID_USB_REVISION=0100 ID_USB_TYPE=hid ID_USB_DRIVER=usbhid MAJOR=13 MINOR=0 The first approach is to just pass the udev socket (and db files, more on this later) from the host. Sure, every application will get the event that a new device has been plugged, so this kind of defeats isolation; but since we are mounting only in one container, this should still work, right? Unfortunately, there’s another issue: when Wolf creates a new virtual device, it will in turn automatically trigger the udev event to be \"broadcast\" to every listening application and if this happens before we are able to mknod the device it’ll result in an application that can’t access the device that we’ve created. We want to be able to be in control of exactly when these events will be sent so that the flow is as follows: Figure 2. The order here matters, the udev events must be sent after the mount Since we have no control over udev and we can’t mount a device before it’s created we have to replicate the events that are generated by it and broadcast them in the same way to all listening applications. First, let’s take a step back; how are application communicating with udev? Though udev runs in userspace, it is highly entangled with the Linux kernel. The first entry that recognizes device insertion/deletion events is surely the Linux kernel. While there were no mechanisms for the Linux kernel to push notifications to userspace processes (with ioctl() the kernel can only provide responses for the corresponding requests from userspace processes), netlink IPC mechanism emerged and currently it is available for the kernel to send a notification first. — https://insujang.github.io/2018-11-27/udev-device-manager-for-the-linux-kernel-in-userspace/ Normally udevd does the following steps: Listens for kernel events via the netlink socket (GROUP_KERNEL) When it receives a new device event, it’ll run all the rules that are defined Send back the \"augmented\" message via another netlink socket (GROUP_UDEV) The two different groups are crucial, whilst every user application can listen the GROUP_KERNEL events only the kernel can be the origin for those messages. GROUP_UDEV being an user space group instead can be \"impersonated\" by any user space application [3]. Since this will run in Docker there’s an additional mechanism that we have to keep in mind: network namespaces. Since udevd communicates via netlink a container that doesn’t run with --network=host will not receive those events; we’ll have to run our custom udev sender inside the container network namespace in order to achieve full isolation. There are 3 main components that needs to be \"faked\" in order for tricking programs that are using libudev into using our fake events: create a file under /run/udev/control this is not used for anything else apart from detection that udev is present AFAIU. send a valid NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT event via netlink using GROUP_UDEV generate the appropriate DB entries in /run/udev/data/ these are just plain text files where the filename is just c: and the content is roughly the same as the event message payload The result of all this is our little CLI utility called fake-udev which we’ll install into our containers and call with our custom-generated events after mknod. echo -ne \\\"ACTION=add\\\\0DEVNAME=input/bomb\\\\0DEVPATH=/devices/bomb\\\\0SEQNUM=1234\\\\0SUBSYSTEM=input\\\\0\\\" | base64 | sudo fake-udev # `udevadm monitor` should print something like: UDEV [3931.403835] add /devices/bomb (input) These steps will finally achieve proper hotplug detection by the applications that are running inside a Docker container without exposing any udev event/file from the host filesystem. Luckily, reversing the steps is enough to also correctly unplug devices. First off, a huge thanks goes to John McDonough for all the help in figuring most of this stuff out and for leading the way with his prototype JohnCMcDonough/virtual-gamepad. 1. This obviously requires also the MKNOD capability to be enabled (--cap-add MKNOD) 2. Some application might react to the new device if it’s using inotify, unfortunately, this is not the default behaviour in most apps/games 3.

The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing. — gstreamer.freedesktop.org We implemented two custom plugins (one for video and one for audio) in order to turn a stream of bytes into a stream of valid Moonlight RTP packets. This allows users to be able to compose Gstreamer pipelines in any form or shape and, near the end, plug our plugin so that it can be streamed to Moonlight. Figure 1. Our plugin sits between the encoded bitestream and a downstream UDP sink that will send the RTP packets to Moonlight The basic flow is the following: The plugin receives a GstBuffer of binary data: the encoded video or audio stream into a format that can be decoded back by the Moonlight client. We’ll split this into a GstBufferList of valid RTP packets following the Moonlight specifications; this includes: split the original buffer into a set of correctly sized chunks Encrypt the chunks when enabled add RTP headers to each chunk create additional RTP packets with the FEC information Push the resulting list downstream Figure 2. An example pipeline for video encoding and streaming Figure 3. An example pipeline for audio encoding and streaming This flow is general enough to enable us to use the same plugin for H.264, HEVC and AV1 (and any other encoder that will be supported in future). Downstream, it’s also trivial to switch between UDP/TCP or even a complete different delivery method if needed. We decided to split between audio and video because they have different RTP packet structure, non overlapping properties, different FEC encoding and different encryption requirements but the basic flow is the same for both plugins. Given that this is a direct transformation from one input buffer to another output buffer we decided to use GstBaseTransform as the base class. This will implement some boilerplate code for us so that we can focus on the main _transform virtual method implementation. Following the nomenclature used in the official GStreamer RTP plugins we called them rtpmoonlightpay_video and rtpmoonlightpay_audio as in RTP Moonlight Payloader video/audio. GStreamer uses GObjects: a mechanism to retrofit Objects into C. I suggest you to get a bit familiar with it before diving into the code; here’s a great and simple tutorial. Following the official docs at Plugin Write’s Guide we started off with the official bash script that creates the boilerplate code from the selected base class; namely: gstrtpmoonlightpay_video.hpp and gstrtpmoonlightpay_video.cpp contain all the boilerplate code needed to setup a plugin, property definitions, etc. gstrtpmoonlightpay_audio.hpp and gstrtpmoonlightpay_audio.cpp for audio. video.hpp contains all the functions that turns a linear buffer of data into a list of correctly formed RTP packets. audio.hpp same for audio","title":"GStreamer","component":"wolf","version":"dev-wolfapi","name":"gstreamer","url":"/wolf/dev-wolfapi/dev/gstreamer.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"The plugin","hash":"_the_plugin","id":2},{"text":"Code","hash":"_code","id":3}]},"68":{"id":68,"text":"Wolf is composed of a few independent components that, when used together, allow us to run and stream multiple graphical applications on the same server without any overlap between them. In order to create virtual desktops on-demand, we’ve created a custom (micro) Wayland compositor: gst-wayland-display. It’s based on Smithay, coded in Rust and exposes both a standalone GStreamer plugin and an easy-to-use C API. The main benefit of this solution is that our compositor will then expose the raw framebuffer so that Wolf can feed that directly to the video encoding pipeline. You can read more about it in Headless Wayland. To keep things simple, our Wayland compositor doesn’t support XWayland, for containers that need it (like Steam) we use Gamescope which can be run as a Wayland client, and it’ll provide XWayland support to the downstream app. Audio doesn’t need any HW acceleration, it’s fairly trivial to run PulseAudio as a standalone container and use libpulse in order to create virtual audio sink on-demand. Creating and managing virtual devices is handled by inputtino: a small library that abstracts away the complexities of managing uinput (and uhid) to create virtual input devices. Virtual devices created by inputtino will be visible on the host system and can potentially break the host isolation that we’re trying to achieve. In order to avoid this, we encourage users to install a set of udev rules that will restrict access to these devices to a specific group (e.g. input) and move mouse and keyboard to a different seat (see user:quickstart.adoc#_virtual_devices_support). You can read a more detailed explanation into why we’ve added uhid and how gyro/acceleration is achieved here Some devices like mouse and keyboard are always present and will be automatically created and setup before starting the application. Other devices can be hotplugged whilst the streaming is running; for example, a gamepad can be plugged in after the game has started. Special care is needed in order to safely mount these new devices in the app container and to make them available to the running application, there’s an in-depth article about it here: Hotplug in Docker We run applications in a containerised environment, this way we can ensure that the application will not interfere with the host system (and with other running apps) and that it will have access only to the virtual devices that we’ve created. We have a set of pre-built containers that are optimised to work with our flow in games-on-whales/gow. Generally, though, most of the GUI applications should work inside a container that can then be streamed via Wolf. We use GStreamer to encode the video and audio streams and send them to the client. We have automatic support for HW acceleration using CUDA, QuickSync and VAAPI but thanks to GStreamer we can easily add more encoders into the mix, without having to write a single line of code! The full encoding pipeline is described in a string that can be overridden by users just by changing the config.toml file. We’ve implemented a couple of custom GStreamer plugins in order to properly split, RTP encode and add FEC to the resulting buffers into the format that Moonlight expects; they live in here: src/moonlight-server/gst-plugin.","title":"How does it work?","component":"wolf","version":"dev-wolfapi","name":"how-it-works","url":"/wolf/dev-wolfapi/dev/how-it-works.html","titles":[{"text":"Virtual desktop","hash":"_virtual_desktop","id":1},{"text":"Virtual audio","hash":"_virtual_audio","id":2},{"text":"Virtual input devices","hash":"_virtual_input_devices","id":3},{"text":"Support hotplug via fake-udev","hash":"_support_hotplug_via_fake_udev","id":4},{"text":"Running applications/games","hash":"_running_applicationsgames","id":5},{"text":"Streaming","hash":"_streaming","id":6}]},"69":{"id":69,"text":"We provide a devcontainer configuration that will allow you to automatically setup a development environment for Wolf.

You can just use ximagesrc and hook your host X11 desktop to the stream but there are some issues with that: Xorg has to be up and running; we can run it via Docker in GOW but that’s not without its challenges. You need a physical monitor or a dummy plugged into your GPU (or some esoteric EDID trick which works only when also performing a human sacrifice). It doesn’t scale well with multiple remote clients when sharing a single host Ideally, can’t we just plug the shared video memory from the running App straight into Gstreamer ?? In theory, for a single fullscreen application that’s kind of possible (read until the end to get an idea of why it’s not so simple); but we need some way to compose multiple running windows into a single scene to be then encoded via the Gstreamer pipeline. Turns out that’s exactly what a Compositing window manager (or compositor) does, and since you can’t have just a compositor without the full X Window System (X11) running, we decided to follow the Wayland route. We are in a very fortunate position: we don’t even want to deal with real monitors, we just want to be the glue between an application running and the Gstreamer pipeline; for this reason we can have a simplified view (and implementation). Figure 1. A high level overview of the main components Let’s dive into each of these parts in isolation. The Wayland protocol does not include a rendering API. Instead, Wayland follows a direct rendering model, in which the client must render the window contents to a buffer shareable with the compositor. — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(protocol)#Rendering_model By removing the X server from the picture we also removed the mechanism by which X clients typically render, but there’s another mechanism: direct rendering. With direct rendering, the client and the server share a video memory buffer. The client links to a rendering library such as OpenGL that knows how to program the hardware and renders directly into the buffer. The compositor in turn can take the buffer and use it as a texture when it composites the desktop. One simple way to implement this buffer would be to use shm as a simple shared region between clients and the server. Most Wayland compositors do their rendering on the GPU, and many Wayland clients do their rendering on the GPU as well. With the shared memory approach, sending buffers from the client to the compositor in such cases is very inefficient, as the client has to read their data from the GPU to the CPU, then the compositor has to read it from the CPU back to the GPU to be rendered. The Linux DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) interface provides a means for us to export handles to GPU resources. Mesa, the predominant implementation of userspace Linux graphics drivers, implements a protocol that allows EGL users to transfer handles to their GPU buffers from the client to the compositor for rendering, without ever copying data to the GPU. Wayland is designed to update everything atomically, such that no frame is ever presented in an invalid or intermediate state. Our custom Wayland compositor knows where to get the rendered buffers, but it doesn’t know when the buffer is ready to be rendered; here’s where the Wayland protocol comes into play. Client surfaces will start in a pending state (and no state at all when first created), this state is negotiated over the course of any number of requests from clients and events from the server; when both sides agree that it’s a consistent surface, the surface is committed. Until this time, the compositor will continue to render the last consistent state. In Wayland, instead of continuously pushing new frames, you can let the compositor tell you when it’s ready for a new frame using frame callbacks. The compositor must finally compose the various surfaces into a single image, in order to do that efficiently we’ll also use EGL. Figure 2. The compositor communicates with the apps via the Wayland protocol, and compose surfaces via EGL Our compositor finally composed an image, and we are ready to send this to our Moonlight client, how do we push this to the selected encoder in the Gstreamer pipeline without copying? Sad news is, we don’t (at least currently). Although Gstreamer supports DMA Buffers (Direct Memory Access) which are an efficient way to share memory without going through the CPU, the support for modifiers of DMA Buffers is lacking behind significantly and varyies from one plugin to the next. What are modifiers? Modifiers add additional vendor specific properties to the internal pixel layout of a buffer. These modifiers are usually internally used by the GPU to speed up certain operations depending on characteristics of the hardware. None of this really has to worry us, because all of that is handled by the gpu driver. But because DMA buffers exist outside of the scope of a singular device, we need to carry the modifier of the buffer along. If it gets lost on the way, the program receiving the buffer has no idea how the data is layed out in memory and will likely output a broken image. Modifiers as such a crucial for communicating formats across devices, but they haven’t existed all the time. So called \"explicit\" modifiers are a relatively new addition to the apis in question. Previously the drivers managed modifiers internally without exposing them to the user. Buffers without an accompanying modifier are as such described as having an \"implicit\" modifier. Because the modifier is handled internally by the driver communication across devices is impossible with such a buffer. Because these changes are relatively new, a lot of software still has to adapt to the new explicit apis and many try to be able to handle both, implicit and explicit buffers. Gstreamer being composed of many plugins currently results in very different stages of transitioning between these apis. Some apis even got support for explicit modifiers, only to drop it a release later, because users of older plugins were complaining about incompatibilities…​ This means the chance of getting a good image out of the pipeline starting with a DMA Buffer is very small. Given the state of things, we are currently copying the buffer through host-memory once to side-step this issue for now. The plan for the future is to provide first an experimental option for using DMA buffers, and later with more testing and development we will hopefully be able to share, compose and finally encode different buffer types with zero memory copied between the GPU and the CPU for truely the best possible latency.

RTP header format in bits FEC packets will also add the followings 12 bytes after the RTP header and before the FEC actual information: Figure 2. FEC additional header format in bits All parameters for properly encoding using Opus are exchanged via the RTSP phase. In order to debug what’s exchanged it might be useful to checkout the RFC 6716 #section-3.1 which defines the Opus packet formats; from the specs: A well-formed Opus packet MUST contain at least one byte [R1]. This byte forms a table-of-contents (TOC) header that signals which of the various modes and configurations a given packet uses. It is composed of a configuration number, \"config\", a stereo flag, \"s\", and a frame count code, \"c\" Figure 3. The first byte of any Opus packet Encoded audio packets will be AES encrypted before being sent over the wire, key and IV are exchanged via HTTPS when calling the launch endpoint. These are the same key and IV used to also encrypt the Control stream. Uses Reed Solomon to encode the payload so that it can be checked on the receiving end for transmission errors (and possibly fix them). This operation will create extra parity blocks that will be sent in separate RTP packets.","title":"Audio stream via RTP","component":"wolf","version":"dev-wolfapi","name":"rtp-opus","url":"/wolf/dev-wolfapi/protocols/rtp-opus.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"PING","hash":"_ping","id":2},{"text":"RTP packets","hash":"_rtp_packets","id":3},{"text":"Opus encoder","hash":"_opus_encoder","id":4},{"text":"AES encryption","hash":"_aes_encryption","id":5},{"text":"Forward Error Correction (FEC)","hash":"_forward_error_correction_fec","id":6}]},"76":{"id":76,"text":"Here are a few random notes about the low level details of the video streaming protocol in Moonlight. The port exchanged during the RTSP phase it’s not where the actual video stream will take place! Moonlight will send a PING package to the exchanged port, this will tell us which random port the connecting client was able to open in order to communicate with Wolf. The client port from where Wolf receives the PING will also be the one where the actual RTP stream will be sent to. This is necessary because usually clients will be behind NAT. The video binary NAL unit (see below) will be separated in chunks of packetSize (default: 1024, exchanged during RTSP) + RTP_HEADER_SIZE (16 byte).

RTSP messages are plaintext packets of variable size over TCP. Parsing of RTSP messages has been implemented using a formal PEG (Parsing Expression Grammars) definition; you can find it in parser.hpp. There are two types of message: request and response All messages have the following structure: message: required options: optional, zero or more key value options separated by newline payload: optional, extra unstructured data that needs to be passed. An example request message OPTIONS rtsp://192.168.1.100:48010 RTSP/1.0 (1) CSeq: 1 (2) X-GS-ClientVersion: 14 (3) (4) a=fmtp:97 surround-params=21101 (5) 1 message: 2 option 1 3 option 2 4 empty new line (end of options) 5 payload The message part is the first line, it’s delimited by the newline character (\\r\\n) , and it’s composed by: command: the first string, delimited by , the command to be executed on the backend; one of: [OPTIONS, DESCRIBE, SETUP, ANNOUNCE, PLAY] target: the second string, delimited by , specifies the ip address and port that is the target of the session. protocol: last string, delimited by , the RTSP protocol in use. Optional additional key values to be passed, delimited by the newline character (\\r\\n). The end of the options section is marked by an extra newline character (\\r\\n). Honorable mention goes to CSeq which is always present and represent the sequence number. Any extra unstructured text that it’s added after the end of the options before the end of the message will be parsed as the payload. Like requests, responses have a message, zero or more options and an optional payload. The main difference is in the format of the message. You can easily identify a response package by looking at the command part which is always RTSP. An example response message RTSP/1.0 200 OK (1) CSeq: 1 (2) a=fmtp:97 surround-params=21101 (3) 1 message 2 option 3 payload Unlike requests a message in a response is composed by different parts: protocol: it’s always RTSP/* and it’s the easiest way to discriminate between request and response messages. status code: follows the HTTP status codes specification status string: follows the HTTP status codes specification","title":"RTSP","component":"wolf","version":"dev-wolfapi","name":"rtsp","url":"/wolf/dev-wolfapi/protocols/rtsp.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"RTSP specifications","hash":"_rtsp_specifications","id":2},{"text":"Request message","hash":"_request_message","id":3},{"text":"Message","hash":"_message","id":4},{"text":"Options","hash":"_options","id":5},{"text":"Payload","hash":"_payload","id":6},{"text":"Response message","hash":"_response_message","id":7},{"text":"Message","hash":"_message_2","id":8}]},"78":{"id":78,"text":"Wolf is configured via a TOML config file and some additional optional ENV variables Variable Default Description WOLF_LOG_LEVEL INFO The log level to show, one of ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE WOLF_CFG_FILE /etc/wolf/cfg/config.toml Full path to the config file WOLF_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE /etc/wolf/cfg/key.pem Full path to the key.pem file WOLF_PRIVATE_CERT_FILE /etc/wolf/cfg/cert.pem Full path to the cert.pem file XDG_RUNTIME_DIR /tmp/sockets The full path where PulseAudio and video sockets will reside, this path is expected to be present in the host and mounted in the Wolf container WOLF_PULSE_IMAGE ghcr.io/games-on-whales/pulseaudio:master The name of the PulseAudio image to be started (when no connection is available) WOLF_STOP_CONTAINER_ON_EXIT TRUE Set to False in order to avoid force stop and removal of containers when the connection is closed WOLF_DOCKER_SOCKET /var/run/docker.sock The full path to the docker socket, doesn’t support tcp (yet) NVIDIA_DRIVER_VOLUME_NAME nvidia-driver-vol The name of the externally created Docker Volume that holds the Nvidia drivers HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER /etc/wolf The base folder in the host where the running apps will store permanent state WOLF_RENDER_NODE /dev/dri/renderD128 The default render node used for virtual desktops; see: Multiple GPUs WOLF_ENCODER_NODE $WOLF_RENDER_NODE The default render node used for the Gstreamer pipelines; see: Multiple GPUs WOLF_DOCKER_FAKE_UDEV_PATH $HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER/fake-udev The path on the host for the fake-udev CLI tool Additional env variables useful when debugging: Variable Default Description RUST_BACKTRACE full In case an exception is thrown in the Rust code, this sets the backtrace level GST_DEBUG 2 Gstreamer debug print, see debugging-tools Since Wolf supports multiple streaming sessions at the same time and each session can run a different app, we need to make sure that each app has its own folder where it can store permanent data. To achieve this, for each running app, Wolf will create a folder structure like this: ${HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER}/${app_state_folder}/${app_title} and then mount that as the home (/home/retro) for the docker container that will run the selected app. These 3 variables are defined as follows: HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER: defaults to /etc/wolf, can be changed via ENV app_state_folder: defaults to a unique identifier for each client so that every Moonlight session will have its own folder. Can be changed in the config.toml file app_title: the title of the app as defined in the config.toml file This will break isolation, if you want to connect with multiple clients at the same time you should not share the home folder. You can follow development of that feature here By default, Wolf will create a new home folder for each client, but if you want to share the same home folder with multiple clients, you can set the app_state_folder to the same value for each paired client; example: [[paired_clients]] app_state_folder = \"common\" # ../../../../bus/virtio/drivers/virtio_gpu (1) /sys/class/drm/renderD129/device/driver -> ../../../../bus/pci/drivers/nvidia (2) 1 This line will tell you that renderD128 is a virtual GPU 2 This line will tell you that renderD129 is a Nvidia GPU Wolf supports also overriding the render node in each single app defined in the config.toml config file by setting the render_node property; example: [apps.runner] type = \"docker\" name = \"WolfSteam\" image = \"ghcr.io/games-on-whales/steam:edge\" # More options here, removed for brevity... render_node = \"/dev/dri/renderD129\" The easy way to control this is to just edit the env variable WOLF_ENCODER_NODE (defaults to match WOLF_RENDER_NODE in order to use the same GPU for both), this will set the default render node used for the Gstreamer pipelines. The streaming video encoding pipeline is fully controlled by the config.toml file; here the order in which entries are listed is important because Wolf will just try each listed plugin; the first one that works is the one that will be used. If you have an Intel iGPU and a Nvidia card in the same host, and you would like to use QuickSync in order to do the encoding, you can either: Delete the nvcodec entries under gstreamer.video.hevc_encoders Cut the qsv entry and paste it above the nvcodec entry On top of that, each single apps entry support overriding the default streaming pipeline; for example: [[apps]] title = \"Test ball\" # More options here, removed for brevity... [apps.video] source = \"\"\" videotestsrc pattern=ball flip=true is-live=true ! video/x-raw, framerate={fps}/1 \\ \"\"\" In case you have two GPUs that will use the same encoder pipeline (example: an AMD iGPU and an AMD GPU card) you can override the video_params with the corresponding encoder plugin; see: gstreamer/issues/1167. This has been moved to the steam.adoc page. This guide demonstrates how to change the default keyboard layout and switch between multiple layouts in Docker containers. For Layout and Variant codes see: https://man.archlinux.org/man/xkeyboard-config.7#LAYOUTS Add environment variable XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT= and XKB_DEFAULT_VARIANT= to [apps.runner] config. Keyboard layout environment variable example [apps.runner] env = [ # ... \"XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT=fr\", \"XKB_DEFAULT_VARIANT=azerty\", ] Using configuration file allow more layouts to be configured. Note: configuration file is only supported for Sway compositor and won’t have any effect wih Gamescope. Create a config file at ${HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER}/cfg/90-custom.conf with the following content: input type:keyboard { xkb_layout \"fr,us\" xkb_numlock \"enable\" } xkb_layout : The first layout code you set will be the default layout. Add other layouts separated by commas. xkb_numlock \"enable\" turns on NumLock by default. In the same folder, edit ${HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER}/cfg/config.toml For each container where you want to use the custom layout, edit the \"mounts\" variable as follows: mounts = [ \"${HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER}/cfg/90-custom.conf:/etc/sway/config.d/90-custom.conf\", ] This ensures that the config is not overwritten. On the next app restart, the keyboard layout will be set to the default one specified. Start the console in Moonlight. Use the command: swaymsg input type:keyboard xkb_switch_layout next In Steam, add a \"Non-Steam Game\", and select anything as the target. Once the game is created in Steam, Right-click on it and select \"Properties\". In the \"Target\" field, enter: /bin/bash -c \"swaymsg input type:keyboard xkb_switch_layout next\" Rename the game to \"Switch Layout\". Close the properties window. You now have a clickable link in Steam to switch layouts.","title":"Configuration","component":"wolf","version":"dev-wolfapi","name":"configuration","url":"/wolf/dev-wolfapi/user/configuration.html","titles":[{"text":"ENV variables","hash":"_env_variables","id":1},{"text":"Where apps will store permanent data?","hash":"data_setup","id":2},{"text":"Share home folder with multiple clients","hash":"_share_home_folder_with_multiple_clients","id":3},{"text":"Change the HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER","hash":"_change_the_host_apps_state_folder","id":4},{"text":"TOML file","hash":"_toml_file","id":5},{"text":"Defining apps","hash":"_defining_apps","id":6},{"text":"Override the default joypad mapping","hash":"_override_the_default_joypad_mapping","id":7},{"text":"Input mouse overrides","hash":"_input_mouse_overrides","id":8},{"text":"App Runner","hash":"_app_runner","id":9},{"text":"Process","hash":"_process","id":10},{"text":"Docker","hash":"_docker","id":11},{"text":"Gstreamer","hash":"_gstreamer","id":12},{"text":"CO-OP sessions","hash":"_co_op_sessions","id":13},{"text":"Set Window compositor","hash":"_set_window_compositor","id":14},{"text":"Multiple GPUs","hash":"_multiple_gpu","id":15},{"text":"App render node","hash":"_app_render_node","id":16},{"text":"Gstreamer video encoding","hash":"_gstreamer_video_encoding","id":17},{"text":"Directly launch a Steam game","hash":"_directly_launch_a_steam_game","id":18},{"text":"Changing and Switching Keyboard Layouts in wolf Apps Containers","hash":"_changing_and_switching_keyboard_layouts_in_wolf_apps_containers","id":19},{"text":"Using environment variable","hash":"_using_environment_variable","id":20},{"text":"Using configuration file","hash":"_using_configuration_file","id":21},{"text":"Create a Configuration File","hash":"_create_a_configuration_file","id":22},{"text":"Configure Container Mounts","hash":"_configure_container_mounts","id":23},{"text":"Switching Layouts","hash":"_switching_layouts","id":24},{"text":"Switching layout from the console in moonlight","hash":"_switching_layout_from_the_console_in_moonlight","id":25},{"text":"Creating a Steam Shortcut for Layout Switching","hash":"_creating_a_steam_shortcut_for_layout_switching","id":26}]},"79":{"id":79,"text":"To list the installed plugins use: gst-inspect-1.0 To analyse some media use: gst-discoverer-1.0 -v https://storage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4 To test out pipelines in your system use: gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc !

The downside of this method is that you have to manually re-create the Nvidia driver volume every time you update the drivers. Unfortunately, on Nvidia, things are a little bit more complex.. Make sure that your driver version is >= 530.30.02 First, let’s build an additional docker image that will contain the Nvidia driver files: curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/games-on-whales/gow/master/images/nvidia-driver/Dockerfile | docker build -t gow/nvidia-driver:latest -f - --build-arg NV_VERSION=$(cat /sys/module/nvidia/version) . This will create gow/nvidia-driver:latest locally. Unfortunately, docker doesn’t seem to support directly mounting images, but you can pre-polulate volumes by running: docker create --rm --mount source=nvidia-driver-vol,destination=/usr/nvidia gow/nvidia-driver:latest sh It will create a Docker container, populate nvidia-driver-vol with Nvidia driver if it wasn’t already done and remove the container. Check volume exists with: docker volume ls | grep nvidia-driver local nvidia-driver-vol One last final check: we have to make sure that the nvidia-drm module has been loaded and that the module is loaded with the flag modeset=1. sudo cat /sys/module/nvidia_drm/parameters/modeset Y I get N or the file is not present, how do I set the flag?

First, create a new file nvidia.conf in the /etc/modules-load.d/ directory and open it with a text editor. nano /etc/modules-load.d/nvidia.conf paste the following content to the file: nvidia nvidia_uvm For the changes to take effect, update the initramfs file with the following command: update-initramfs -u Add udev rules to add missing Nvidia devices nano /etc/udev/rules.d/70-nvidia.rules paste the following content to the file: # create necessary NVIDIA device files in /dev/* KERNEL==\"nvidia\", RUN+=\"/bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/nvidia-smi -L && /bin/chmod 0666 /dev/nvidia*'\" KERNEL==\"nvidia_uvm\", RUN+=\"/bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/nvidia-modprobe -c0 -u && /bin/chmod 0666 /dev/nvidia-uvm*'\" reboot you host and try running ls -l /dev/nvidia* again. Running Wolf in WSL2 hasn’t been properly tested. You can run Wolf in a very unprivileged setting without uinput/uhid, unfortunately this means that you’ll be restricted to only using mouse and keyboard. For Nvidia users, follow the Nvidia instructions above. This should work for AMD/Intel users. docker run \\ --name wolf \\ --network=host \\ -e XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/sockets \\ -v /tmp/sockets:/tmp/sockets:rw \\ -e HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER=/etc/wolf \\ -v /etc/wolf:/etc/wolf:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ --device /dev/dri/ \\ ghcr.io/games-on-whales/wolf:stable At the moment it is only possible to run Wolf inside a privileged LXC. First you need to make sure your GPU drivers are installed and loaded on your PVE host. Also make sure to add the virtual devices udev rules to the PVE host as explained in the Virtual devices support section. Now, we need to edit LXC config file to passtrough the GPU. I don’t have a LXC yet The easiest way to create an LXC to run Wolf is to use tteck’s PVE docker script, this will create you a LXC with docker already good to go. (Make sure you choose privileged LXC and install docker-compose when prompted) Enter the LXC config file: nano /etc/pve/lxc/1XX.conf it should look similar to this: arch: amd64 cores: 8 features: nesting=1 hostname: wolf memory: 8192 net0: name=eth0,bridge=vmbr0,hwaddr=BC:24:11:B7:90:5D,ip=dhcp,type=veth onboot: 1 ostype: debian rootfs: local-lvm:vm-118-disk-0,size=128G swap: 512 tags: proxmox-helper-scripts lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: a lxc.cap.drop: lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 188:* rwm lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 189:* rwm lxc.mount.entry: /dev/serial/by-id dev/serial/by-id none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyUSB0 dev/ttyUSB0 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyUSB1 dev/ttyUSB1 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyACM0 dev/ttyACM0 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyACM1 dev/ttyACM1 none bind,optional,create=file remove the following lines from the bottom, they are not needed: lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 188:* rwm lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 189:* rwm lxc.mount.entry: /dev/serial/by-id dev/serial/by-id none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyUSB0 dev/ttyUSB0 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyUSB1 dev/ttyUSB1 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyACM0 dev/ttyACM0 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyACM1 dev/ttyACM1 none bind,optional,create=file add these lines to the bottom of the file: For Nvidia dev0: /dev/uinput dev1: /dev/uhid dev2: /dev/nvidia0 dev3: /dev/nvidiactl dev4: /dev/nvidia-modeset dev5: /dev/nvidia-uvm dev6: /dev/nvidia-uvm-tools dev7: /dev/nvidia-caps/nvidia-cap1 dev8: /dev/nvidia-caps/nvidia-cap2 lxc.mount.entry: /dev/dri dev/dri none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /dev/input dev/input none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /run/udev mnt/udev none bind,optional,create=dir For Intel/AMD dev0: /dev/uinput dev1: /dev/uhid lxc.mount.entry: /dev/dri dev/dri none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /dev/input dev/input none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /run/udev mnt/udev none bind,optional,create=dir save the file, exit, and restart your LXC. Your LXC is good to go, complete the installation based on the GPU following the other tabs. When creating your docker-compose.yml don’t forget to modify the volume mapping for /run/udev path, as we mounted it on /mnt/udev inside our LXC volumes: - /mnt/udev:/run/udev:rw And if you have a multi GPU setup, don’t forget to set the below env variable environment: - WOLF_RENDER_NODE=/dev/dri/renderD12X Which ports are used by Wolf? To keep things simple the scripts above defaulted to network:host; that’s not really required, the minimum set of ports that needs to be exposed are: # HTTPS EXPOSE 47984/tcp # HTTP EXPOSE 47989/tcp # Control EXPOSE 47999/udp # RTSP EXPOSE 48010/tcp # Video (up to 10 users, you can open more ports if needed) EXPOSE 48100-48110/udp # Audio (up to 10 users, you can open more ports if needed) EXPOSE 48200-48210/udp You should now be able to point Moonlight to the IP address of the server and start the pairing process: In Moonlight, you’ll get a prompt for a PIN Wolf will log a line with a link to a page where you can input that PIN (ex: http://localhost:47989/pin/#337327E8A6FC0C66 make sure to replace localhost with your server IP) In Moonlight, you should now be able to see a list of the applications that are supported by Wolf If you can only see a black screen with a cursor in Moonlight it’s because the first time that you start an app Wolf will download the corresponding docker image + first time updates. Keep an eye on the logs from Wolf to get more details. We use uinput to create virtual devices (Mouse, Keyboard and Joypad), make sure that /dev/uinput is present in the host: ls -la /dev/uinput crw------- 1 root root 10, 223 Jan 17 09:08 /dev/uinput Add your user to group input sudo usermod -a -G input $USER Create udev rules under /etc/udev/rules.d/85-wolf-virtual-inputs.rules # Allows Wolf to acces /dev/uinput KERNEL==\"uinput\", SUBSYSTEM==\"misc\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", OPTIONS+=\"static_node=uinput\" # Allows Wolf to access /dev/uhid KERNEL==\"uhid\", TAG+=\"uaccess\" # Move virtual keyboard and mouse into a different seat SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{id/vendor}==\"ab00\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", ENV{ID_SEAT}=\"seat9\" # Joypads SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf X-Box One (virtual) pad\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf PS5 (virtual) pad\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf gamepad (virtual) motion sensors\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf Nintendo (virtual) pad\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" What does that mean? KERNEL==\"uinput\", SUBSYSTEM==\"misc\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", OPTIONS+=\"static_node=uinput\" Allows Wolf to access /dev/uinput on your system. It needs that node to create the virtual devices. This is usually not the default on servers, but if that is already working for you on your desktop system, you can skip this line. SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{id/vendor}==\"ab00\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", ENV{ID_SEAT}=\"seat9\" This line checks for the custom vendor-id that Wolf gives to newly created virtual devices and assigns them to seat9, which will cause any session with a lower seat (usually you only have seat1 for your main session) to ignore the devices. SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf X-Box One (virtual) pad\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf PS5 (virtual) pad\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf gamepad (virtual) motion sensors\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf Nintendo (virtual) pad\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" Now the virtual controllers are different, because we need to emulate an existing brand for them to be picked up correctly, so our virtual controllers have a vendor/product id resembling a real controller. The assigned name instead is specific to Wolf. You can’t assign controllers a seat however (well - you can - but it won’t have the same effect), so we just give it permissions where only user+group can pick it up.

If it’s the very first time that you are running an app, and you can only see a black screen with a cursor in Moonlight, it’s probably because Wolf is downloading the corresponding docker image and installing first time updates (when necessary). If this persists or Moonlight kicks you out of the streaming session then you should probably take a look at the Wolf logs to gather more informations.

Once the container is launched, Wolf streams the output to the connected Moonlight client. Currently, when opening and closing the app through Moonlight, the app container will be deleted. Therefore, all data except for the mounted paths will be deleted, which ensures application consistency to some extent. However, if modifications to the container are needed, such as installing additional software, the best approach is to create a custom app image. Wolf uses the same app image as in the GoW project. Therefore, you can refer to this link for customizing app content. See each subpage for further details and additional configuration steps. If you want to build your own app, you can use the following template: Clone the GOW repo git clone https://github.com/games-on-whales/gow.git All the published images are in the images/ directory. You can edit any of the images or create a new one. For example, say that you want to add another emulator to ES-DE: Edit the images/es-de/Dockerfile file and add the necessary software. Build the image: open a shell in the root of the GOW repo, then use Docker to build with the following command: This will build the image locally with the tag gow/es-de:custom. docker build -t gow/es-de:custom --build-arg BASE_APP_IMAGE=ghcr.io/games-on-whales/base-app:edge images/es-de . Finally, update the config.toml file in Wolf to use the new image. Just change the image field under [apps.runner] to the newly locally built gow/es-de:custom. Don’t forget to contribute back by creating a pull request in games-on-whales/gow! I want to edit something in base or base-app Our builds are hierarchical: all images are based on base-app which is based on base. You can build them with: docker build -t gow/base images/base . docker build -t gow/base-app --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=gow/base images/base-app . If you have a desktop environment running on your host, you can run the built image without even using Wolf. Here’s an example of running Steam inside Docker on a Wayland host without installing anything else on your host: docker run --name=steam --rm -it \\ --device=/dev/dri/renderD128 \\ --device=/dev/dri/card0 \\ --ipc=host \\ --cap-add=ALL \\ --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \\ -e XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp \\ -v ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/${WAYLAND_DISPLAY}:/tmp/${WAYLAND_DISPLAY}:rw \\ -e XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland \\ -e WAYLAND_DISPLAY=${WAYLAND_DISPLAY} \\ -e RUN_SWAY=true \\ -v /tmp/SteamGOWData:/home/retro/ \\ ghcr.io/games-on-whales/steam:edge Figure 1. The Steam big picture mode should start on your host in a normal window Depending on your host setup, you might need to adjust this command. For example, for Nvidia users with the container toolkit installed you might need to add --gpus=all instead of --device=/dev/dri/renderD128 --device=/dev/dri/card0 and -e NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all to the environment variables. In the command above /tmp/SteamGOWData in your host is where the home folder (containing Steam client and settings in this example) will be stored, make sure to adjust that to your liking.","title":"Apps","component":"wolf","version":"dev-zero-copy","name":"index","url":"/wolf/dev-zero-copy/apps/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Build your own","hash":"_build_your_own","id":2},{"text":"Example: edit an already existing image","hash":"_example_edit_an_already_existing_image","id":3},{"text":"Testing out an image locally","hash":"_testing_out_an_image_locally","id":4}]},"84":{"id":84,"text":"Table of Contents Introduction Getting Started ROM Directory Structure Setting Up ROM Directories Configuration Setting Up Bind Mounts for ROMs Example Configuration Emulators Customization Theming Troubleshooting and Additional Resources Pegasus is a powerful and flexible frontend for launching games, similar to EmulationStation. It provides a unified interface for interacting with various emulators, eliminating the need to manage multiple emulator interfaces separately. By default, Pegasus is configured to look for ROMs in the /ROMs directory, with subdirectories for each platform. You can either create the ROM directories in the format below or edit Pegasus to use your preferred location. /ROMs/3do /ROMs/amiga /ROMs/amigacd32 /ROMs/arcade /ROMs/atari2600 /ROMs/atari5200 /ROMs/atari7800 /ROMs/atarijaguar /ROMs/atarijaguarcd /ROMs/atarilynx /ROMs/atarist /ROMs/gb /ROMs/gba /ROMs/gbc /ROMs/gc /ROMs/genesis /ROMs/megacd /ROMs/model2 /ROMs/model3 /ROMs/n64 /ROMs/naomi /ROMs/neogeo /ROMs/nes /ROMs/ngp /ROMs/ngpc /ROMs/ps2 /ROMs/ps3 /ROMs/psp /ROMs/psx /ROMs/saturn /ROMs/sega32x /ROMs/segacd /ROMs/snes /ROMs/snes_widescreen /ROMs/switch /ROMs/virtualboy /ROMs/wii /ROMs/wiiu /ROMs/wonderswan /ROMs/wonderswancolor /ROMs/xbox To make your roms accessible to Pegasus within the container, you need to create a bind mount that maps your host ROM folder to the /ROMs directory in the container. This is done by editing the config.toml file. To create a bind mount for your ROMs, add the following line to the \"HostConfig\" section of your config.toml: \"Binds\": [ \"/path/to/roms:/ROMs\" ] Replace /path/to/roms with the actual path to your ROM directory on the host system.

We (try to) follow a functional programming paradigm where all the methods take immutable inputs and returns new outputs; this has great benefits: Given the highly parallel nature of Wolf, we can easily share immutable data structures to multiple threads without having to deal with race conditions. This gives us the power to support multiple concurrent users effortlessly. Code can easily be re-used by other projects since every part is highly decoupled. Enables testing most of the implemented methods in isolation. We are also trying to isolate the Moonlight protocol from the actual implementation so that we can create a portable C++ library of stateless methods, where possible, the code has been separated in logical modules. High-level utilities and re-usable libraries, not strictly tied to Moonlight or Wolf: docker.hpp: using libcurl and boost json to interrogate the Docker socket and provide an easy to use interface to most methods. input.hpp: an easy to use virtual input device library; supports mouse, keyboard, joypads and more! virtual-display.hpp: a simple abstraction on top of games-on-whales/gst-wayland-display in order to create and control virtual desktops. audio.hpp: a simple abstraction on top of libpulse to create and control virtual audio devices.

In order to keep modules decoupled most of the logic revolves around reacting to events in a shared event bus (implemented using DeveloperPaul123/eventbus). Unit tests will live under tests/ and are written using the Catch2 framework. We are implementing unit tests for most of the methods and (where possible) also mocking packets/requests seen during real Moonlight sessions.

A working example: connecting a joypad to the client triggers the right detection in RetroArch running in the server. Wolf creates virtual devices on-demand based on the packets that are received from Moonlight clients over the control stream. When a new virtual device is created, we have to \"mount\" it inside the right running Docker container since, in order to achieve isolation, we can’t run them with the privileged flag. Normally, Docker assigns devices available to a container at creation time. Fortunately, it supports a more permissive rule that allows to access a wider range of devices based on the device major:minor. By adding the --device-cgroup-rule we can then call mknod [1] from inside the container in order to mount the virtual devices on-demand from the outside. Example Docker command issued by Wolf docker exec -it sh -c \"mknod /dev/input/ c :\" We’ve mounted the right device into the right container, still, no application is picking it up [2]. We have to trigger some kind of \"event\" in order to advertise that a new device has arrived, turns out those kind of events are generated by udev. An example udev event when you plug a joypad UDEV [3588.199301] add /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.3/0000:02:00.0/usb1/1-1/1-1:1.3/0003:054C:0CE6.0007/input/input20/js0 (input) ACTION=add SUBSYSTEM=input DEVNAME=/dev/input/js0 ID_BUS=usb ID_MODEL=Wireless_Controller ID_SERIAL=Sony_Interactive_Entertainment_Wireless_Controller ID_VENDOR=Sony_Interactive_Entertainment ID_VENDOR_ENC=Sony\\x20Interactive\\x20Entertainment ID_VENDOR_ID=054c ID_REVISION=0100 ID_TYPE=hid ID_USB_VENDOR_ID=054c ID_USB_REVISION=0100 ID_USB_TYPE=hid ID_USB_DRIVER=usbhid MAJOR=13 MINOR=0 The first approach is to just pass the udev socket (and db files, more on this later) from the host. Sure, every application will get the event that a new device has been plugged, so this kind of defeats isolation; but since we are mounting only in one container, this should still work, right? Unfortunately, there’s another issue: when Wolf creates a new virtual device, it will in turn automatically trigger the udev event to be \"broadcast\" to every listening application and if this happens before we are able to mknod the device it’ll result in an application that can’t access the device that we’ve created. We want to be able to be in control of exactly when these events will be sent so that the flow is as follows: Figure 2. The order here matters, the udev events must be sent after the mount Since we have no control over udev and we can’t mount a device before it’s created we have to replicate the events that are generated by it and broadcast them in the same way to all listening applications. First, let’s take a step back; how are application communicating with udev? Though udev runs in userspace, it is highly entangled with the Linux kernel. The first entry that recognizes device insertion/deletion events is surely the Linux kernel. While there were no mechanisms for the Linux kernel to push notifications to userspace processes (with ioctl() the kernel can only provide responses for the corresponding requests from userspace processes), netlink IPC mechanism emerged and currently it is available for the kernel to send a notification first. — https://insujang.github.io/2018-11-27/udev-device-manager-for-the-linux-kernel-in-userspace/ Normally udevd does the following steps: Listens for kernel events via the netlink socket (GROUP_KERNEL) When it receives a new device event, it’ll run all the rules that are defined Send back the \"augmented\" message via another netlink socket (GROUP_UDEV) The two different groups are crucial, whilst every user application can listen the GROUP_KERNEL events only the kernel can be the origin for those messages. GROUP_UDEV being an user space group instead can be \"impersonated\" by any user space application [3]. Since this will run in Docker there’s an additional mechanism that we have to keep in mind: network namespaces. Since udevd communicates via netlink a container that doesn’t run with --network=host will not receive those events; we’ll have to run our custom udev sender inside the container network namespace in order to achieve full isolation. There are 3 main components that needs to be \"faked\" in order for tricking programs that are using libudev into using our fake events: create a file under /run/udev/control this is not used for anything else apart from detection that udev is present AFAIU. send a valid NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT event via netlink using GROUP_UDEV generate the appropriate DB entries in /run/udev/data/ these are just plain text files where the filename is just c: and the content is roughly the same as the event message payload The result of all this is our little CLI utility called fake-udev which we’ll install into our containers and call with our custom-generated events after mknod. echo -ne \\\"ACTION=add\\\\0DEVNAME=input/bomb\\\\0DEVPATH=/devices/bomb\\\\0SEQNUM=1234\\\\0SUBSYSTEM=input\\\\0\\\" | base64 | sudo fake-udev # `udevadm monitor` should print something like: UDEV [3931.403835] add /devices/bomb (input) These steps will finally achieve proper hotplug detection by the applications that are running inside a Docker container without exposing any udev event/file from the host filesystem. Luckily, reversing the steps is enough to also correctly unplug devices. First off, a huge thanks goes to John McDonough for all the help in figuring most of this stuff out and for leading the way with his prototype JohnCMcDonough/virtual-gamepad. 1. This obviously requires also the MKNOD capability to be enabled (--cap-add MKNOD) 2. Some application might react to the new device if it’s using inotify, unfortunately, this is not the default behaviour in most apps/games 3.

The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing. — gstreamer.freedesktop.org We implemented two custom plugins (one for video and one for audio) in order to turn a stream of bytes into a stream of valid Moonlight RTP packets. This allows users to be able to compose Gstreamer pipelines in any form or shape and, near the end, plug our plugin so that it can be streamed to Moonlight. Figure 1. Our plugin sits between the encoded bitestream and a downstream UDP sink that will send the RTP packets to Moonlight The basic flow is the following: The plugin receives a GstBuffer of binary data: the encoded video or audio stream into a format that can be decoded back by the Moonlight client. We’ll split this into a GstBufferList of valid RTP packets following the Moonlight specifications; this includes: split the original buffer into a set of correctly sized chunks Encrypt the chunks when enabled add RTP headers to each chunk create additional RTP packets with the FEC information Push the resulting list downstream Figure 2. An example pipeline for video encoding and streaming Figure 3. An example pipeline for audio encoding and streaming This flow is general enough to enable us to use the same plugin for H.264, HEVC and AV1 (and any other encoder that will be supported in future). Downstream, it’s also trivial to switch between UDP/TCP or even a complete different delivery method if needed. We decided to split between audio and video because they have different RTP packet structure, non overlapping properties, different FEC encoding and different encryption requirements but the basic flow is the same for both plugins. Given that this is a direct transformation from one input buffer to another output buffer we decided to use GstBaseTransform as the base class. This will implement some boilerplate code for us so that we can focus on the main _transform virtual method implementation. Following the nomenclature used in the official GStreamer RTP plugins we called them rtpmoonlightpay_video and rtpmoonlightpay_audio as in RTP Moonlight Payloader video/audio. GStreamer uses GObjects: a mechanism to retrofit Objects into C. I suggest you to get a bit familiar with it before diving into the code; here’s a great and simple tutorial. Following the official docs at Plugin Write’s Guide we started off with the official bash script that creates the boilerplate code from the selected base class; namely: gstrtpmoonlightpay_video.hpp and gstrtpmoonlightpay_video.cpp contain all the boilerplate code needed to setup a plugin, property definitions, etc. gstrtpmoonlightpay_audio.hpp and gstrtpmoonlightpay_audio.cpp for audio. video.hpp contains all the functions that turns a linear buffer of data into a list of correctly formed RTP packets. audio.hpp same for audio","title":"GStreamer","component":"wolf","version":"dev-zero-copy","name":"gstreamer","url":"/wolf/dev-zero-copy/dev/gstreamer.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"The plugin","hash":"_the_plugin","id":2},{"text":"Code","hash":"_code","id":3}]},"91":{"id":91,"text":"Wolf is composed of a few independent components that, when used together, allow us to run and stream multiple graphical applications on the same server without any overlap between them. In order to create virtual desktops on-demand, we’ve created a custom (micro) Wayland compositor: gst-wayland-display. It’s based on Smithay, coded in Rust and exposes both a standalone GStreamer plugin and an easy-to-use C API. The main benefit of this solution is that our compositor will then expose the raw framebuffer so that Wolf can feed that directly to the video encoding pipeline. You can read more about it in Headless Wayland. To keep things simple, our Wayland compositor doesn’t support XWayland, for containers that need it (like Steam) we use Gamescope which can be run as a Wayland client, and it’ll provide XWayland support to the downstream app. Audio doesn’t need any HW acceleration, it’s fairly trivial to run PulseAudio as a standalone container and use libpulse in order to create virtual audio sink on-demand. Creating and managing virtual devices is handled by inputtino: a small library that abstracts away the complexities of managing uinput (and uhid) to create virtual input devices. Virtual devices created by inputtino will be visible on the host system and can potentially break the host isolation that we’re trying to achieve. In order to avoid this, we encourage users to install a set of udev rules that will restrict access to these devices to a specific group (e.g. input) and move mouse and keyboard to a different seat (see user:quickstart.adoc#_virtual_devices_support). You can read a more detailed explanation into why we’ve added uhid and how gyro/acceleration is achieved here Some devices like mouse and keyboard are always present and will be automatically created and setup before starting the application. Other devices can be hotplugged whilst the streaming is running; for example, a gamepad can be plugged in after the game has started. Special care is needed in order to safely mount these new devices in the app container and to make them available to the running application, there’s an in-depth article about it here: Hotplug in Docker We run applications in a containerised environment, this way we can ensure that the application will not interfere with the host system (and with other running apps) and that it will have access only to the virtual devices that we’ve created. We have a set of pre-built containers that are optimised to work with our flow in games-on-whales/gow. Generally, though, most of the GUI applications should work inside a container that can then be streamed via Wolf. We use GStreamer to encode the video and audio streams and send them to the client. We have automatic support for HW acceleration using CUDA, QuickSync and VAAPI but thanks to GStreamer we can easily add more encoders into the mix, without having to write a single line of code! The full encoding pipeline is described in a string that can be overridden by users just by changing the config.toml file. We’ve implemented a couple of custom GStreamer plugins in order to properly split, RTP encode and add FEC to the resulting buffers into the format that Moonlight expects; they live in here: src/moonlight-server/gst-plugin.","title":"How does it work?","component":"wolf","version":"dev-zero-copy","name":"how-it-works","url":"/wolf/dev-zero-copy/dev/how-it-works.html","titles":[{"text":"Virtual desktop","hash":"_virtual_desktop","id":1},{"text":"Virtual audio","hash":"_virtual_audio","id":2},{"text":"Virtual input devices","hash":"_virtual_input_devices","id":3},{"text":"Support hotplug via fake-udev","hash":"_support_hotplug_via_fake_udev","id":4},{"text":"Running applications/games","hash":"_running_applicationsgames","id":5},{"text":"Streaming","hash":"_streaming","id":6}]},"92":{"id":92,"text":"We provide a devcontainer configuration that will allow you to automatically setup a development environment for Wolf.

You can just use ximagesrc and hook your host X11 desktop to the stream but there are some issues with that: Xorg has to be up and running; we can run it via Docker in GOW but that’s not without its challenges. You need a physical monitor or a dummy plugged into your GPU (or some esoteric EDID trick which works only when also performing a human sacrifice). It doesn’t scale well with multiple remote clients when sharing a single host Ideally, can’t we just plug the shared video memory from the running App straight into Gstreamer ?? In theory, for a single fullscreen application that’s kind of possible (read until the end to get an idea of why it’s not so simple); but we need some way to compose multiple running windows into a single scene to be then encoded via the Gstreamer pipeline. Turns out that’s exactly what a Compositing window manager (or compositor) does, and since you can’t have just a compositor without the full X Window System (X11) running, we decided to follow the Wayland route. We are in a very fortunate position: we don’t even want to deal with real monitors, we just want to be the glue between an application running and the Gstreamer pipeline; for this reason we can have a simplified view (and implementation). Figure 1. A high level overview of the main components Let’s dive into each of these parts in isolation. The Wayland protocol does not include a rendering API. Instead, Wayland follows a direct rendering model, in which the client must render the window contents to a buffer shareable with the compositor. — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(protocol)#Rendering_model By removing the X server from the picture we also removed the mechanism by which X clients typically render, but there’s another mechanism: direct rendering. With direct rendering, the client and the server share a video memory buffer. The client links to a rendering library such as OpenGL that knows how to program the hardware and renders directly into the buffer. The compositor in turn can take the buffer and use it as a texture when it composites the desktop. One simple way to implement this buffer would be to use shm as a simple shared region between clients and the server. Most Wayland compositors do their rendering on the GPU, and many Wayland clients do their rendering on the GPU as well. With the shared memory approach, sending buffers from the client to the compositor in such cases is very inefficient, as the client has to read their data from the GPU to the CPU, then the compositor has to read it from the CPU back to the GPU to be rendered. The Linux DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) interface provides a means for us to export handles to GPU resources. Mesa, the predominant implementation of userspace Linux graphics drivers, implements a protocol that allows EGL users to transfer handles to their GPU buffers from the client to the compositor for rendering, without ever copying data to the GPU. Wayland is designed to update everything atomically, such that no frame is ever presented in an invalid or intermediate state. Our custom Wayland compositor knows where to get the rendered buffers, but it doesn’t know when the buffer is ready to be rendered; here’s where the Wayland protocol comes into play. Client surfaces will start in a pending state (and no state at all when first created), this state is negotiated over the course of any number of requests from clients and events from the server; when both sides agree that it’s a consistent surface, the surface is committed. Until this time, the compositor will continue to render the last consistent state. In Wayland, instead of continuously pushing new frames, you can let the compositor tell you when it’s ready for a new frame using frame callbacks. The compositor must finally compose the various surfaces into a single image, in order to do that efficiently we’ll also use EGL. Figure 2. The compositor communicates with the apps via the Wayland protocol, and compose surfaces via EGL Our compositor finally composed an image, and we are ready to send this to our Moonlight client, how do we push this to the selected encoder in the Gstreamer pipeline without copying? Sad news is, we don’t (at least currently). Although Gstreamer supports DMA Buffers (Direct Memory Access) which are an efficient way to share memory without going through the CPU, the support for modifiers of DMA Buffers is lacking behind significantly and varyies from one plugin to the next. What are modifiers? Modifiers add additional vendor specific properties to the internal pixel layout of a buffer. These modifiers are usually internally used by the GPU to speed up certain operations depending on characteristics of the hardware. None of this really has to worry us, because all of that is handled by the gpu driver. But because DMA buffers exist outside of the scope of a singular device, we need to carry the modifier of the buffer along. If it gets lost on the way, the program receiving the buffer has no idea how the data is layed out in memory and will likely output a broken image. Modifiers as such a crucial for communicating formats across devices, but they haven’t existed all the time. So called \"explicit\" modifiers are a relatively new addition to the apis in question. Previously the drivers managed modifiers internally without exposing them to the user. Buffers without an accompanying modifier are as such described as having an \"implicit\" modifier. Because the modifier is handled internally by the driver communication across devices is impossible with such a buffer. Because these changes are relatively new, a lot of software still has to adapt to the new explicit apis and many try to be able to handle both, implicit and explicit buffers. Gstreamer being composed of many plugins currently results in very different stages of transitioning between these apis. Some apis even got support for explicit modifiers, only to drop it a release later, because users of older plugins were complaining about incompatibilities…​ This means the chance of getting a good image out of the pipeline starting with a DMA Buffer is very small. Given the state of things, we are currently copying the buffer through host-memory once to side-step this issue for now. The plan for the future is to provide first an experimental option for using DMA buffers, and later with more testing and development we will hopefully be able to share, compose and finally encode different buffer types with zero memory copied between the GPU and the CPU for truely the best possible latency.

FEC additional header format in bits All parameters for properly encoding using Opus are exchanged via the RTSP phase. In order to debug what’s exchanged it might be useful to checkout the RFC 6716 #section-3.1 which defines the Opus packet formats; from the specs: A well-formed Opus packet MUST contain at least one byte [R1]. This byte forms a table-of-contents (TOC) header that signals which of the various modes and configurations a given packet uses. It is composed of a configuration number, \"config\", a stereo flag, \"s\", and a frame count code, \"c\" Figure 3. The first byte of any Opus packet Encoded audio packets will be AES encrypted before being sent over the wire, key and IV are exchanged via HTTPS when calling the launch endpoint. These are the same key and IV used to also encrypt the Control stream.

This operation will create extra parity blocks that will be sent in separate RTP packets.","title":"Audio stream via RTP","component":"wolf","version":"dev-zero-copy","name":"rtp-opus","url":"/wolf/dev-zero-copy/protocols/rtp-opus.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"PING","hash":"_ping","id":2},{"text":"RTP packets","hash":"_rtp_packets","id":3},{"text":"Opus encoder","hash":"_opus_encoder","id":4},{"text":"AES encryption","hash":"_aes_encryption","id":5},{"text":"Forward Error Correction (FEC)","hash":"_forward_error_correction_fec","id":6}]},"99":{"id":99,"text":"Here are a few random notes about the low level details of the video streaming protocol in Moonlight. The port exchanged during the RTSP phase it’s not where the actual video stream will take place! Moonlight will send a PING package to the exchanged port, this will tell us which random port the connecting client was able to open in order to communicate with Wolf. The client port from where Wolf receives the PING will also be the one where the actual RTP stream will be sent to. This is necessary because usually clients will be behind NAT. The video binary NAL unit (see below) will be separated in chunks of packetSize (default: 1024, exchanged during RTSP) + RTP_HEADER_SIZE (16 byte). The first 32 bytes of each packet are defined as follows: Figure 1. RTP header format in bits Figure 2.

RTSP messages are plaintext packets of variable size over TCP. Parsing of RTSP messages has been implemented using a formal PEG (Parsing Expression Grammars) definition; you can find it in parser.hpp. There are two types of message: request and response All messages have the following structure: message: required options: optional, zero or more key value options separated by newline payload: optional, extra unstructured data that needs to be passed. An example request message OPTIONS rtsp://192.168.1.100:48010 RTSP/1.0 (1) CSeq: 1 (2) X-GS-ClientVersion: 14 (3) (4) a=fmtp:97 surround-params=21101 (5) 1 message: 2 option 1 3 option 2 4 empty new line (end of options) 5 payload The message part is the first line, it’s delimited by the newline character (\\r\\n) , and it’s composed by: command: the first string, delimited by , the command to be executed on the backend; one of: [OPTIONS, DESCRIBE, SETUP, ANNOUNCE, PLAY] target: the second string, delimited by , specifies the ip address and port that is the target of the session. protocol: last string, delimited by , the RTSP protocol in use. Optional additional key values to be passed, delimited by the newline character (\\r\\n). The end of the options section is marked by an extra newline character (\\r\\n). Honorable mention goes to CSeq which is always present and represent the sequence number. Any extra unstructured text that it’s added after the end of the options before the end of the message will be parsed as the payload. Like requests, responses have a message, zero or more options and an optional payload. The main difference is in the format of the message. You can easily identify a response package by looking at the command part which is always RTSP. An example response message RTSP/1.0 200 OK (1) CSeq: 1 (2) a=fmtp:97 surround-params=21101 (3) 1 message 2 option 3 payload Unlike requests a message in a response is composed by different parts: protocol: it’s always RTSP/* and it’s the easiest way to discriminate between request and response messages. status code: follows the HTTP status codes specification status string: follows the HTTP status codes specification","title":"RTSP","component":"wolf","version":"dev-zero-copy","name":"rtsp","url":"/wolf/dev-zero-copy/protocols/rtsp.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"RTSP specifications","hash":"_rtsp_specifications","id":2},{"text":"Request message","hash":"_request_message","id":3},{"text":"Message","hash":"_message","id":4},{"text":"Options","hash":"_options","id":5},{"text":"Payload","hash":"_payload","id":6},{"text":"Response message","hash":"_response_message","id":7},{"text":"Message","hash":"_message_2","id":8}]},"101":{"id":101,"text":"Wolf is configured via a TOML config file and some additional optional ENV variables Variable Default Description WOLF_LOG_LEVEL INFO The log level to show, one of ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE WOLF_CFG_FILE /etc/wolf/cfg/config.toml Full path to the config file WOLF_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE /etc/wolf/cfg/key.pem Full path to the key.pem file WOLF_PRIVATE_CERT_FILE /etc/wolf/cfg/cert.pem Full path to the cert.pem file XDG_RUNTIME_DIR /tmp/sockets The full path where PulseAudio and video sockets will reside, this path is expected to be present in the host and mounted in the Wolf container WOLF_PULSE_IMAGE ghcr.io/games-on-whales/pulseaudio:master The name of the PulseAudio image to be started (when no connection is available) WOLF_STOP_CONTAINER_ON_EXIT TRUE Set to False in order to avoid force stop and removal of containers when the connection is closed WOLF_DOCKER_SOCKET /var/run/docker.sock The full path to the docker socket, doesn’t support tcp (yet) NVIDIA_DRIVER_VOLUME_NAME nvidia-driver-vol The name of the externally created Docker Volume that holds the Nvidia drivers HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER /etc/wolf The base folder in the host where the running apps will store permanent state WOLF_RENDER_NODE /dev/dri/renderD128 The default render node used for virtual desktops; see: Multiple GPUs WOLF_ENCODER_NODE $WOLF_RENDER_NODE The default render node used for the Gstreamer pipelines; see: Multiple GPUs WOLF_DOCKER_FAKE_UDEV_PATH $HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER/fake-udev The path on the host for the fake-udev CLI tool Additional env variables useful when debugging: Variable Default Description RUST_BACKTRACE full In case an exception is thrown in the Rust code, this sets the backtrace level GST_DEBUG 2 Gstreamer debug print, see debugging-tools Since Wolf supports multiple streaming sessions at the same time and each session can run a different app, we need to make sure that each app has its own folder where it can store permanent data. To achieve this, for each running app, Wolf will create a folder structure like this: ${HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER}/${app_state_folder}/${app_title} and then mount that as the home (/home/retro) for the docker container that will run the selected app. These 3 variables are defined as follows: HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER: defaults to /etc/wolf, can be changed via ENV app_state_folder: defaults to a unique identifier for each client so that every Moonlight session will have its own folder. Can be changed in the config.toml file app_title: the title of the app as defined in the config.toml file This will break isolation, if you want to connect with multiple clients at the same time you should not share the home folder. You can follow development of that feature here By default, Wolf will create a new home folder for each client, but if you want to share the same home folder with multiple clients, you can set the app_state_folder to the same value for each paired client; example: [[paired_clients]] app_state_folder = \"common\" # ../../../../bus/virtio/drivers/virtio_gpu (1) /sys/class/drm/renderD129/device/driver -> ../../../../bus/pci/drivers/nvidia (2) 1 This line will tell you that renderD128 is a virtual GPU 2 This line will tell you that renderD129 is a Nvidia GPU Wolf supports also overriding the render node in each single app defined in the config.toml config file by setting the render_node property; example: [apps.runner] type = \"docker\" name = \"WolfSteam\" image = \"ghcr.io/games-on-whales/steam:edge\" # More options here, removed for brevity... render_node = \"/dev/dri/renderD129\" The easy way to control this is to just edit the env variable WOLF_ENCODER_NODE (defaults to match WOLF_RENDER_NODE in order to use the same GPU for both), this will set the default render node used for the Gstreamer pipelines. The streaming video encoding pipeline is fully controlled by the config.toml file; here the order in which entries are listed is important because Wolf will just try each listed plugin; the first one that works is the one that will be used. If you have an Intel iGPU and a Nvidia card in the same host, and you would like to use QuickSync in order to do the encoding, you can either: Delete the nvcodec entries under gstreamer.video.hevc_encoders Cut the qsv entry and paste it above the nvcodec entry On top of that, each single apps entry support overriding the default streaming pipeline; for example: [[apps]] title = \"Test ball\" # More options here, removed for brevity... [apps.video] source = \"\"\" videotestsrc pattern=ball flip=true is-live=true ! video/x-raw, framerate={fps}/1 \\ \"\"\" In case you have two GPUs that will use the same encoder pipeline (example: an AMD iGPU and an AMD GPU card) you can override the video_params with the corresponding encoder plugin; see: gstreamer/issues/1167. This has been moved to the steam.adoc page. This guide demonstrates how to change the default keyboard layout and switch between multiple layouts in Docker containers. For Layout and Variant codes see: https://man.archlinux.org/man/xkeyboard-config.7#LAYOUTS Add environment variable XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT= and XKB_DEFAULT_VARIANT= to [apps.runner] config. Keyboard layout environment variable example [apps.runner] env = [ # ... \"XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT=fr\", \"XKB_DEFAULT_VARIANT=azerty\", ] Using configuration file allow more layouts to be configured. Note: configuration file is only supported for Sway compositor and won’t have any effect wih Gamescope. Create a config file at ${HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER}/cfg/90-custom.conf with the following content: input type:keyboard { xkb_layout \"fr,us\" xkb_numlock \"enable\" } xkb_layout : The first layout code you set will be the default layout. Add other layouts separated by commas. xkb_numlock \"enable\" turns on NumLock by default. In the same folder, edit ${HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER}/cfg/config.toml For each container where you want to use the custom layout, edit the \"mounts\" variable as follows: mounts = [ \"${HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER}/cfg/90-custom.conf:/etc/sway/config.d/90-custom.conf\", ] This ensures that the config is not overwritten. On the next app restart, the keyboard layout will be set to the default one specified. Start the console in Moonlight. Use the command: swaymsg input type:keyboard xkb_switch_layout next In Steam, add a \"Non-Steam Game\", and select anything as the target. Once the game is created in Steam, Right-click on it and select \"Properties\". In the \"Target\" field, enter: /bin/bash -c \"swaymsg input type:keyboard xkb_switch_layout next\" Rename the game to \"Switch Layout\". Close the properties window. You now have a clickable link in Steam to switch layouts.","title":"Configuration","component":"wolf","version":"dev-zero-copy","name":"configuration","url":"/wolf/dev-zero-copy/user/configuration.html","titles":[{"text":"ENV variables","hash":"_env_variables","id":1},{"text":"Where apps will store permanent data?","hash":"data_setup","id":2},{"text":"Share home folder with multiple clients","hash":"_share_home_folder_with_multiple_clients","id":3},{"text":"Change the HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER","hash":"_change_the_host_apps_state_folder","id":4},{"text":"TOML file","hash":"_toml_file","id":5},{"text":"Defining apps","hash":"_defining_apps","id":6},{"text":"Override the default joypad mapping","hash":"_override_the_default_joypad_mapping","id":7},{"text":"Input mouse overrides","hash":"_input_mouse_overrides","id":8},{"text":"App Runner","hash":"_app_runner","id":9},{"text":"Process","hash":"_process","id":10},{"text":"Docker","hash":"_docker","id":11},{"text":"Gstreamer","hash":"_gstreamer","id":12},{"text":"CO-OP sessions","hash":"_co_op_sessions","id":13},{"text":"Set Window compositor","hash":"_set_window_compositor","id":14},{"text":"Multiple GPUs","hash":"_multiple_gpu","id":15},{"text":"App render node","hash":"_app_render_node","id":16},{"text":"Gstreamer video encoding","hash":"_gstreamer_video_encoding","id":17},{"text":"Directly launch a Steam game","hash":"_directly_launch_a_steam_game","id":18},{"text":"Changing and Switching Keyboard Layouts in wolf Apps Containers","hash":"_changing_and_switching_keyboard_layouts_in_wolf_apps_containers","id":19},{"text":"Using environment variable","hash":"_using_environment_variable","id":20},{"text":"Using configuration file","hash":"_using_configuration_file","id":21},{"text":"Create a Configuration File","hash":"_create_a_configuration_file","id":22},{"text":"Configure Container Mounts","hash":"_configure_container_mounts","id":23},{"text":"Switching Layouts","hash":"_switching_layouts","id":24},{"text":"Switching layout from the console in moonlight","hash":"_switching_layout_from_the_console_in_moonlight","id":25},{"text":"Creating a Steam Shortcut for Layout Switching","hash":"_creating_a_steam_shortcut_for_layout_switching","id":26}]},"102":{"id":102,"text":"To list the installed plugins use: gst-inspect-1.0 To analyse some media use: gst-discoverer-1.0 -v https://storage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4 To test out pipelines in your system use: gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc !

The downside of this method is that you have to manually re-create the Nvidia driver volume every time you update the drivers. Unfortunately, on Nvidia, things are a little bit more complex.. Make sure that your driver version is >= 530.30.02 First, let’s build an additional docker image that will contain the Nvidia driver files: curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/games-on-whales/gow/master/images/nvidia-driver/Dockerfile | docker build -t gow/nvidia-driver:latest -f - --build-arg NV_VERSION=$(cat /sys/module/nvidia/version) . This will create gow/nvidia-driver:latest locally. Unfortunately, docker doesn’t seem to support directly mounting images, but you can pre-polulate volumes by running: docker create --rm --mount source=nvidia-driver-vol,destination=/usr/nvidia gow/nvidia-driver:latest sh It will create a Docker container, populate nvidia-driver-vol with Nvidia driver if it wasn’t already done and remove the container. Check volume exists with: docker volume ls | grep nvidia-driver local nvidia-driver-vol One last final check: we have to make sure that the nvidia-drm module has been loaded and that the module is loaded with the flag modeset=1. sudo cat /sys/module/nvidia_drm/parameters/modeset Y I get N or the file is not present, how do I set the flag?

First, create a new file nvidia.conf in the /etc/modules-load.d/ directory and open it with a text editor. nano /etc/modules-load.d/nvidia.conf paste the following content to the file: nvidia nvidia_uvm For the changes to take effect, update the initramfs file with the following command: update-initramfs -u Add udev rules to add missing Nvidia devices nano /etc/udev/rules.d/70-nvidia.rules paste the following content to the file: # create necessary NVIDIA device files in /dev/* KERNEL==\"nvidia\", RUN+=\"/bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/nvidia-smi -L && /bin/chmod 0666 /dev/nvidia*'\" KERNEL==\"nvidia_uvm\", RUN+=\"/bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/nvidia-modprobe -c0 -u && /bin/chmod 0666 /dev/nvidia-uvm*'\" reboot you host and try running ls -l /dev/nvidia* again. Running Wolf in WSL2 hasn’t been properly tested. You can run Wolf in a very unprivileged setting without uinput/uhid, unfortunately this means that you’ll be restricted to only using mouse and keyboard. For Nvidia users, follow the Nvidia instructions above. This should work for AMD/Intel users. docker run \\ --name wolf \\ --network=host \\ -e XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/sockets \\ -v /tmp/sockets:/tmp/sockets:rw \\ -e HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER=/etc/wolf \\ -v /etc/wolf:/etc/wolf:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ --device /dev/dri/ \\ ghcr.io/games-on-whales/wolf:stable At the moment it is only possible to run Wolf inside a privileged LXC. First you need to make sure your GPU drivers are installed and loaded on your PVE host. Also make sure to add the virtual devices udev rules to the PVE host as explained in the Virtual devices support section. Now, we need to edit LXC config file to passtrough the GPU. I don’t have a LXC yet The easiest way to create an LXC to run Wolf is to use tteck’s PVE docker script, this will create you a LXC with docker already good to go. (Make sure you choose privileged LXC and install docker-compose when prompted) Enter the LXC config file: nano /etc/pve/lxc/1XX.conf it should look similar to this: arch: amd64 cores: 8 features: nesting=1 hostname: wolf memory: 8192 net0: name=eth0,bridge=vmbr0,hwaddr=BC:24:11:B7:90:5D,ip=dhcp,type=veth onboot: 1 ostype: debian rootfs: local-lvm:vm-118-disk-0,size=128G swap: 512 tags: proxmox-helper-scripts lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: a lxc.cap.drop: lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 188:* rwm lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 189:* rwm lxc.mount.entry: /dev/serial/by-id dev/serial/by-id none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyUSB0 dev/ttyUSB0 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyUSB1 dev/ttyUSB1 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyACM0 dev/ttyACM0 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyACM1 dev/ttyACM1 none bind,optional,create=file remove the following lines from the bottom, they are not needed: lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 188:* rwm lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 189:* rwm lxc.mount.entry: /dev/serial/by-id dev/serial/by-id none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyUSB0 dev/ttyUSB0 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyUSB1 dev/ttyUSB1 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyACM0 dev/ttyACM0 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyACM1 dev/ttyACM1 none bind,optional,create=file add these lines to the bottom of the file: For Nvidia dev0: /dev/uinput dev1: /dev/uhid dev2: /dev/nvidia0 dev3: /dev/nvidiactl dev4: /dev/nvidia-modeset dev5: /dev/nvidia-uvm dev6: /dev/nvidia-uvm-tools dev7: /dev/nvidia-caps/nvidia-cap1 dev8: /dev/nvidia-caps/nvidia-cap2 lxc.mount.entry: /dev/dri dev/dri none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /dev/input dev/input none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /run/udev mnt/udev none bind,optional,create=dir For Intel/AMD dev0: /dev/uinput dev1: /dev/uhid lxc.mount.entry: /dev/dri dev/dri none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /dev/input dev/input none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /run/udev mnt/udev none bind,optional,create=dir save the file, exit, and restart your LXC. Your LXC is good to go, complete the installation based on the GPU following the other tabs. When creating your docker-compose.yml don’t forget to modify the volume mapping for /run/udev path, as we mounted it on /mnt/udev inside our LXC volumes: - /mnt/udev:/run/udev:rw And if you have a multi GPU setup, don’t forget to set the below env variable environment: - WOLF_RENDER_NODE=/dev/dri/renderD12X Which ports are used by Wolf? To keep things simple the scripts above defaulted to network:host; that’s not really required, the minimum set of ports that needs to be exposed are: # HTTPS EXPOSE 47984/tcp # HTTP EXPOSE 47989/tcp # Control EXPOSE 47999/udp # RTSP EXPOSE 48010/tcp # Video (up to 10 users, you can open more ports if needed) EXPOSE 48100-48110/udp # Audio (up to 10 users, you can open more ports if needed) EXPOSE 48200-48210/udp You should now be able to point Moonlight to the IP address of the server and start the pairing process: In Moonlight, you’ll get a prompt for a PIN Wolf will log a line with a link to a page where you can input that PIN (ex: http://localhost:47989/pin/#337327E8A6FC0C66 make sure to replace localhost with your server IP) In Moonlight, you should now be able to see a list of the applications that are supported by Wolf If you can only see a black screen with a cursor in Moonlight it’s because the first time that you start an app Wolf will download the corresponding docker image + first time updates. Keep an eye on the logs from Wolf to get more details. We use uinput to create virtual devices (Mouse, Keyboard and Joypad), make sure that /dev/uinput is present in the host: ls -la /dev/uinput crw------- 1 root root 10, 223 Jan 17 09:08 /dev/uinput Add your user to group input sudo usermod -a -G input $USER Create udev rules under /etc/udev/rules.d/85-wolf-virtual-inputs.rules # Allows Wolf to acces /dev/uinput KERNEL==\"uinput\", SUBSYSTEM==\"misc\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", OPTIONS+=\"static_node=uinput\" # Allows Wolf to access /dev/uhid KERNEL==\"uhid\", TAG+=\"uaccess\" # Move virtual keyboard and mouse into a different seat SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{id/vendor}==\"ab00\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", ENV{ID_SEAT}=\"seat9\" # Joypads SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf X-Box One (virtual) pad\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf PS5 (virtual) pad\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf gamepad (virtual) motion sensors\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf Nintendo (virtual) pad\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" What does that mean? KERNEL==\"uinput\", SUBSYSTEM==\"misc\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", OPTIONS+=\"static_node=uinput\" Allows Wolf to access /dev/uinput on your system. It needs that node to create the virtual devices. This is usually not the default on servers, but if that is already working for you on your desktop system, you can skip this line. SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{id/vendor}==\"ab00\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", ENV{ID_SEAT}=\"seat9\" This line checks for the custom vendor-id that Wolf gives to newly created virtual devices and assigns them to seat9, which will cause any session with a lower seat (usually you only have seat1 for your main session) to ignore the devices.

The assigned name instead is specific to Wolf. You can’t assign controllers a seat however (well - you can - but it won’t have the same effect), so we just give it permissions where only user+group can pick it up.

If it’s the very first time that you are running an app, and you can only see a black screen with a cursor in Moonlight, it’s probably because Wolf is downloading the corresponding docker image and installing first time updates (when necessary). If this persists or Moonlight kicks you out of the streaming session then you should probably take a look at the Wolf logs to gather more informations.

Once the container is launched, Wolf streams the output to the connected Moonlight client. Currently, when opening and closing the app through Moonlight, the app container will be deleted. Therefore, all data except for the mounted paths will be deleted, which ensures application consistency to some extent. However, if modifications to the container are needed, such as installing additional software, the best approach is to create a custom app image. Wolf uses the same app image as in the GoW project. Therefore, you can refer to this link for customizing app content. See each subpage for further details and additional configuration steps. If you want to build your own app, you can use the following template: Clone the GOW repo git clone https://github.com/games-on-whales/gow.git All the published images are in the images/ directory. You can edit any of the images or create a new one. For example, say that you want to add another emulator to ES-DE: Edit the images/es-de/Dockerfile file and add the necessary software. Build the image: open a shell in the root of the GOW repo, then use Docker to build with the following command: This will build the image locally with the tag gow/es-de:custom. docker build -t gow/es-de:custom --build-arg BASE_APP_IMAGE=ghcr.io/games-on-whales/base-app:edge images/es-de . Finally, update the config.toml file in Wolf to use the new image. Just change the image field under [apps.runner] to the newly locally built gow/es-de:custom. Don’t forget to contribute back by creating a pull request in games-on-whales/gow! I want to edit something in base or base-app Our builds are hierarchical: all images are based on base-app which is based on base. You can build them with: docker build -t gow/base images/base . docker build -t gow/base-app --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=gow/base images/base-app . If you have a desktop environment running on your host, you can run the built image without even using Wolf. Here’s an example of running Steam inside Docker on a Wayland host without installing anything else on your host: docker run --name=steam --rm -it \\ --device=/dev/dri/renderD128 \\ --device=/dev/dri/card0 \\ --ipc=host \\ --cap-add=ALL \\ --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \\ -e XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp \\ -v ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/${WAYLAND_DISPLAY}:/tmp/${WAYLAND_DISPLAY}:rw \\ -e XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland \\ -e WAYLAND_DISPLAY=${WAYLAND_DISPLAY} \\ -e RUN_SWAY=true \\ -v /tmp/SteamGOWData:/home/retro/ \\ ghcr.io/games-on-whales/steam:edge Figure 1. The Steam big picture mode should start on your host in a normal window Depending on your host setup, you might need to adjust this command. For example, for Nvidia users with the container toolkit installed you might need to add --gpus=all instead of --device=/dev/dri/renderD128 --device=/dev/dri/card0 and -e NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all to the environment variables. In the command above /tmp/SteamGOWData in your host is where the home folder (containing Steam client and settings in this example) will be stored, make sure to adjust that to your liking.","title":"Apps","component":"wolf","version":"stable","name":"index","url":"/wolf/stable/apps/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Build your own","hash":"_build_your_own","id":2},{"text":"Example: edit an already existing image","hash":"_example_edit_an_already_existing_image","id":3},{"text":"Testing out an image locally","hash":"_testing_out_an_image_locally","id":4}]},"107":{"id":107,"text":"Table of Contents Introduction Getting Started ROM Directory Structure Setting Up ROM Directories Configuration Setting Up Bind Mounts for ROMs Example Configuration Emulators Customization Theming Troubleshooting and Additional Resources Pegasus is a powerful and flexible frontend for launching games, similar to EmulationStation. It provides a unified interface for interacting with various emulators, eliminating the need to manage multiple emulator interfaces separately. By default, Pegasus is configured to look for ROMs in the /ROMs directory, with subdirectories for each platform. You can either create the ROM directories in the format below or edit Pegasus to use your preferred location. /ROMs/3do /ROMs/amiga /ROMs/amigacd32 /ROMs/arcade /ROMs/atari2600 /ROMs/atari5200 /ROMs/atari7800 /ROMs/atarijaguar /ROMs/atarijaguarcd /ROMs/atarilynx /ROMs/atarist /ROMs/gb /ROMs/gba /ROMs/gbc /ROMs/gc /ROMs/genesis /ROMs/megacd /ROMs/model2 /ROMs/model3 /ROMs/n64 /ROMs/naomi /ROMs/neogeo /ROMs/nes /ROMs/ngp /ROMs/ngpc /ROMs/ps2 /ROMs/ps3 /ROMs/psp /ROMs/psx /ROMs/saturn /ROMs/sega32x /ROMs/segacd /ROMs/snes /ROMs/snes_widescreen /ROMs/switch /ROMs/virtualboy /ROMs/wii /ROMs/wiiu /ROMs/wonderswan /ROMs/wonderswancolor /ROMs/xbox To make your roms accessible to Pegasus within the container, you need to create a bind mount that maps your host ROM folder to the /ROMs directory in the container. This is done by editing the config.toml file. To create a bind mount for your ROMs, add the following line to the \"HostConfig\" section of your config.toml: \"Binds\": [ \"/path/to/roms:/ROMs\" ] Replace /path/to/roms with the actual path to your ROM directory on the host system.

We (try to) follow a functional programming paradigm where all the methods take immutable inputs and returns new outputs; this has great benefits: Given the highly parallel nature of Wolf, we can easily share immutable data structures to multiple threads without having to deal with race conditions. This gives us the power to support multiple concurrent users effortlessly. Code can easily be re-used by other projects since every part is highly decoupled. Enables testing most of the implemented methods in isolation. We are also trying to isolate the Moonlight protocol from the actual implementation so that we can create a portable C++ library of stateless methods, where possible, the code has been separated in logical modules. High-level utilities and re-usable libraries, not strictly tied to Moonlight or Wolf: docker.hpp: using libcurl and boost json to interrogate the Docker socket and provide an easy to use interface to most methods. input.hpp: an easy to use virtual input device library; supports mouse, keyboard, joypads and more! virtual-display.hpp: a simple abstraction on top of games-on-whales/gst-wayland-display in order to create and control virtual desktops. audio.hpp: a simple abstraction on top of libpulse to create and control virtual audio devices.

In order to keep modules decoupled most of the logic revolves around reacting to events in a shared event bus (implemented using DeveloperPaul123/eventbus). Unit tests will live under tests/ and are written using the Catch2 framework. We are implementing unit tests for most of the methods and (where possible) also mocking packets/requests seen during real Moonlight sessions.

A working example: connecting a joypad to the client triggers the right detection in RetroArch running in the server. Wolf creates virtual devices on-demand based on the packets that are received from Moonlight clients over the control stream. When a new virtual device is created, we have to \"mount\" it inside the right running Docker container since, in order to achieve isolation, we can’t run them with the privileged flag. Normally, Docker assigns devices available to a container at creation time. Fortunately, it supports a more permissive rule that allows to access a wider range of devices based on the device major:minor. By adding the --device-cgroup-rule we can then call mknod [1] from inside the container in order to mount the virtual devices on-demand from the outside. Example Docker command issued by Wolf docker exec -it sh -c \"mknod /dev/input/ c :\" We’ve mounted the right device into the right container, still, no application is picking it up [2]. We have to trigger some kind of \"event\" in order to advertise that a new device has arrived, turns out those kind of events are generated by udev. An example udev event when you plug a joypad UDEV [3588.199301] add /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.3/0000:02:00.0/usb1/1-1/1-1:1.3/0003:054C:0CE6.0007/input/input20/js0 (input) ACTION=add SUBSYSTEM=input DEVNAME=/dev/input/js0 ID_BUS=usb ID_MODEL=Wireless_Controller ID_SERIAL=Sony_Interactive_Entertainment_Wireless_Controller ID_VENDOR=Sony_Interactive_Entertainment ID_VENDOR_ENC=Sony\\x20Interactive\\x20Entertainment ID_VENDOR_ID=054c ID_REVISION=0100 ID_TYPE=hid ID_USB_VENDOR_ID=054c ID_USB_REVISION=0100 ID_USB_TYPE=hid ID_USB_DRIVER=usbhid MAJOR=13 MINOR=0 The first approach is to just pass the udev socket (and db files, more on this later) from the host. Sure, every application will get the event that a new device has been plugged, so this kind of defeats isolation; but since we are mounting only in one container, this should still work, right? Unfortunately, there’s another issue: when Wolf creates a new virtual device, it will in turn automatically trigger the udev event to be \"broadcast\" to every listening application and if this happens before we are able to mknod the device it’ll result in an application that can’t access the device that we’ve created. We want to be able to be in control of exactly when these events will be sent so that the flow is as follows: Figure 2. The order here matters, the udev events must be sent after the mount Since we have no control over udev and we can’t mount a device before it’s created we have to replicate the events that are generated by it and broadcast them in the same way to all listening applications. First, let’s take a step back; how are application communicating with udev? Though udev runs in userspace, it is highly entangled with the Linux kernel. The first entry that recognizes device insertion/deletion events is surely the Linux kernel. While there were no mechanisms for the Linux kernel to push notifications to userspace processes (with ioctl() the kernel can only provide responses for the corresponding requests from userspace processes), netlink IPC mechanism emerged and currently it is available for the kernel to send a notification first. — https://insujang.github.io/2018-11-27/udev-device-manager-for-the-linux-kernel-in-userspace/ Normally udevd does the following steps: Listens for kernel events via the netlink socket (GROUP_KERNEL) When it receives a new device event, it’ll run all the rules that are defined Send back the \"augmented\" message via another netlink socket (GROUP_UDEV) The two different groups are crucial, whilst every user application can listen the GROUP_KERNEL events only the kernel can be the origin for those messages. GROUP_UDEV being an user space group instead can be \"impersonated\" by any user space application [3]. Since this will run in Docker there’s an additional mechanism that we have to keep in mind: network namespaces. Since udevd communicates via netlink a container that doesn’t run with --network=host will not receive those events; we’ll have to run our custom udev sender inside the container network namespace in order to achieve full isolation. There are 3 main components that needs to be \"faked\" in order for tricking programs that are using libudev into using our fake events: create a file under /run/udev/control this is not used for anything else apart from detection that udev is present AFAIU. send a valid NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT event via netlink using GROUP_UDEV generate the appropriate DB entries in /run/udev/data/ these are just plain text files where the filename is just c: and the content is roughly the same as the event message payload The result of all this is our little CLI utility called fake-udev which we’ll install into our containers and call with our custom-generated events after mknod. echo -ne \\\"ACTION=add\\\\0DEVNAME=input/bomb\\\\0DEVPATH=/devices/bomb\\\\0SEQNUM=1234\\\\0SUBSYSTEM=input\\\\0\\\" | base64 | sudo fake-udev # `udevadm monitor` should print something like: UDEV [3931.403835] add /devices/bomb (input) These steps will finally achieve proper hotplug detection by the applications that are running inside a Docker container without exposing any udev event/file from the host filesystem. Luckily, reversing the steps is enough to also correctly unplug devices. First off, a huge thanks goes to John McDonough for all the help in figuring most of this stuff out and for leading the way with his prototype JohnCMcDonough/virtual-gamepad. 1. This obviously requires also the MKNOD capability to be enabled (--cap-add MKNOD) 2. Some application might react to the new device if it’s using inotify, unfortunately, this is not the default behaviour in most apps/games 3.

The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing. — gstreamer.freedesktop.org We implemented two custom plugins (one for video and one for audio) in order to turn a stream of bytes into a stream of valid Moonlight RTP packets. This allows users to be able to compose Gstreamer pipelines in any form or shape and, near the end, plug our plugin so that it can be streamed to Moonlight. Figure 1. Our plugin sits between the encoded bitestream and a downstream UDP sink that will send the RTP packets to Moonlight The basic flow is the following: The plugin receives a GstBuffer of binary data: the encoded video or audio stream into a format that can be decoded back by the Moonlight client. We’ll split this into a GstBufferList of valid RTP packets following the Moonlight specifications; this includes: split the original buffer into a set of correctly sized chunks Encrypt the chunks when enabled add RTP headers to each chunk create additional RTP packets with the FEC information Push the resulting list downstream Figure 2. An example pipeline for video encoding and streaming Figure 3. An example pipeline for audio encoding and streaming This flow is general enough to enable us to use the same plugin for H.264, HEVC and AV1 (and any other encoder that will be supported in future). Downstream, it’s also trivial to switch between UDP/TCP or even a complete different delivery method if needed. We decided to split between audio and video because they have different RTP packet structure, non overlapping properties, different FEC encoding and different encryption requirements but the basic flow is the same for both plugins. Given that this is a direct transformation from one input buffer to another output buffer we decided to use GstBaseTransform as the base class. This will implement some boilerplate code for us so that we can focus on the main _transform virtual method implementation. Following the nomenclature used in the official GStreamer RTP plugins we called them rtpmoonlightpay_video and rtpmoonlightpay_audio as in RTP Moonlight Payloader video/audio. GStreamer uses GObjects: a mechanism to retrofit Objects into C. I suggest you to get a bit familiar with it before diving into the code; here’s a great and simple tutorial. Following the official docs at Plugin Write’s Guide we started off with the official bash script that creates the boilerplate code from the selected base class; namely: gstrtpmoonlightpay_video.hpp and gstrtpmoonlightpay_video.cpp contain all the boilerplate code needed to setup a plugin, property definitions, etc. gstrtpmoonlightpay_audio.hpp and gstrtpmoonlightpay_audio.cpp for audio. video.hpp contains all the functions that turns a linear buffer of data into a list of correctly formed RTP packets. audio.hpp same for audio","title":"GStreamer","component":"wolf","version":"stable","name":"gstreamer","url":"/wolf/stable/dev/gstreamer.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"The plugin","hash":"_the_plugin","id":2},{"text":"Code","hash":"_code","id":3}]},"114":{"id":114,"text":"Wolf is composed of a few independent components that, when used together, allow us to run and stream multiple graphical applications on the same server without any overlap between them. In order to create virtual desktops on-demand, we’ve created a custom (micro) Wayland compositor: gst-wayland-display. It’s based on Smithay, coded in Rust and exposes both a standalone GStreamer plugin and an easy-to-use C API. The main benefit of this solution is that our compositor will then expose the raw framebuffer so that Wolf can feed that directly to the video encoding pipeline. You can read more about it in Headless Wayland. To keep things simple, our Wayland compositor doesn’t support XWayland, for containers that need it (like Steam) we use Gamescope which can be run as a Wayland client, and it’ll provide XWayland support to the downstream app. Audio doesn’t need any HW acceleration, it’s fairly trivial to run PulseAudio as a standalone container and use libpulse in order to create virtual audio sink on-demand. Creating and managing virtual devices is handled by inputtino: a small library that abstracts away the complexities of managing uinput (and uhid) to create virtual input devices. Virtual devices created by inputtino will be visible on the host system and can potentially break the host isolation that we’re trying to achieve. In order to avoid this, we encourage users to install a set of udev rules that will restrict access to these devices to a specific group (e.g. input) and move mouse and keyboard to a different seat (see user:quickstart.adoc#_virtual_devices_support). You can read a more detailed explanation into why we’ve added uhid and how gyro/acceleration is achieved here Some devices like mouse and keyboard are always present and will be automatically created and setup before starting the application. Other devices can be hotplugged whilst the streaming is running; for example, a gamepad can be plugged in after the game has started. Special care is needed in order to safely mount these new devices in the app container and to make them available to the running application, there’s an in-depth article about it here: Hotplug in Docker We run applications in a containerised environment, this way we can ensure that the application will not interfere with the host system (and with other running apps) and that it will have access only to the virtual devices that we’ve created. We have a set of pre-built containers that are optimised to work with our flow in games-on-whales/gow. Generally, though, most of the GUI applications should work inside a container that can then be streamed via Wolf. We use GStreamer to encode the video and audio streams and send them to the client. We have automatic support for HW acceleration using CUDA, QuickSync and VAAPI but thanks to GStreamer we can easily add more encoders into the mix, without having to write a single line of code! The full encoding pipeline is described in a string that can be overridden by users just by changing the config.toml file. We’ve implemented a couple of custom GStreamer plugins in order to properly split, RTP encode and add FEC to the resulting buffers into the format that Moonlight expects; they live in here: src/moonlight-server/gst-plugin.","title":"How does it work?","component":"wolf","version":"stable","name":"how-it-works","url":"/wolf/stable/dev/how-it-works.html","titles":[{"text":"Virtual desktop","hash":"_virtual_desktop","id":1},{"text":"Virtual audio","hash":"_virtual_audio","id":2},{"text":"Virtual input devices","hash":"_virtual_input_devices","id":3},{"text":"Support hotplug via fake-udev","hash":"_support_hotplug_via_fake_udev","id":4},{"text":"Running applications/games","hash":"_running_applicationsgames","id":5},{"text":"Streaming","hash":"_streaming","id":6}]},"115":{"id":115,"text":"We provide a devcontainer configuration that will allow you to automatically setup a development environment for Wolf.

You can just use ximagesrc and hook your host X11 desktop to the stream but there are some issues with that: Xorg has to be up and running; we can run it via Docker in GOW but that’s not without its challenges. You need a physical monitor or a dummy plugged into your GPU (or some esoteric EDID trick which works only when also performing a human sacrifice). It doesn’t scale well with multiple remote clients when sharing a single host Ideally, can’t we just plug the shared video memory from the running App straight into Gstreamer ?? In theory, for a single fullscreen application that’s kind of possible (read until the end to get an idea of why it’s not so simple); but we need some way to compose multiple running windows into a single scene to be then encoded via the Gstreamer pipeline. Turns out that’s exactly what a Compositing window manager (or compositor) does, and since you can’t have just a compositor without the full X Window System (X11) running, we decided to follow the Wayland route. We are in a very fortunate position: we don’t even want to deal with real monitors, we just want to be the glue between an application running and the Gstreamer pipeline; for this reason we can have a simplified view (and implementation). Figure 1. A high level overview of the main components Let’s dive into each of these parts in isolation. The Wayland protocol does not include a rendering API. Instead, Wayland follows a direct rendering model, in which the client must render the window contents to a buffer shareable with the compositor. — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(protocol)#Rendering_model By removing the X server from the picture we also removed the mechanism by which X clients typically render, but there’s another mechanism: direct rendering. With direct rendering, the client and the server share a video memory buffer. The client links to a rendering library such as OpenGL that knows how to program the hardware and renders directly into the buffer. The compositor in turn can take the buffer and use it as a texture when it composites the desktop. One simple way to implement this buffer would be to use shm as a simple shared region between clients and the server. Most Wayland compositors do their rendering on the GPU, and many Wayland clients do their rendering on the GPU as well. With the shared memory approach, sending buffers from the client to the compositor in such cases is very inefficient, as the client has to read their data from the GPU to the CPU, then the compositor has to read it from the CPU back to the GPU to be rendered. The Linux DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) interface provides a means for us to export handles to GPU resources. Mesa, the predominant implementation of userspace Linux graphics drivers, implements a protocol that allows EGL users to transfer handles to their GPU buffers from the client to the compositor for rendering, without ever copying data to the GPU. Wayland is designed to update everything atomically, such that no frame is ever presented in an invalid or intermediate state. Our custom Wayland compositor knows where to get the rendered buffers, but it doesn’t know when the buffer is ready to be rendered; here’s where the Wayland protocol comes into play. Client surfaces will start in a pending state (and no state at all when first created), this state is negotiated over the course of any number of requests from clients and events from the server; when both sides agree that it’s a consistent surface, the surface is committed. Until this time, the compositor will continue to render the last consistent state. In Wayland, instead of continuously pushing new frames, you can let the compositor tell you when it’s ready for a new frame using frame callbacks. The compositor must finally compose the various surfaces into a single image, in order to do that efficiently we’ll also use EGL. Figure 2. The compositor communicates with the apps via the Wayland protocol, and compose surfaces via EGL Our compositor finally composed an image, and we are ready to send this to our Moonlight client, how do we push this to the selected encoder in the Gstreamer pipeline without copying? Sad news is, we don’t (at least currently). Although Gstreamer supports DMA Buffers (Direct Memory Access) which are an efficient way to share memory without going through the CPU, the support for modifiers of DMA Buffers is lacking behind significantly and varyies from one plugin to the next. What are modifiers? Modifiers add additional vendor specific properties to the internal pixel layout of a buffer. These modifiers are usually internally used by the GPU to speed up certain operations depending on characteristics of the hardware. None of this really has to worry us, because all of that is handled by the gpu driver. But because DMA buffers exist outside of the scope of a singular device, we need to carry the modifier of the buffer along. If it gets lost on the way, the program receiving the buffer has no idea how the data is layed out in memory and will likely output a broken image. Modifiers as such a crucial for communicating formats across devices, but they haven’t existed all the time. So called \"explicit\" modifiers are a relatively new addition to the apis in question. Previously the drivers managed modifiers internally without exposing them to the user. Buffers without an accompanying modifier are as such described as having an \"implicit\" modifier. Because the modifier is handled internally by the driver communication across devices is impossible with such a buffer. Because these changes are relatively new, a lot of software still has to adapt to the new explicit apis and many try to be able to handle both, implicit and explicit buffers. Gstreamer being composed of many plugins currently results in very different stages of transitioning between these apis. Some apis even got support for explicit modifiers, only to drop it a release later, because users of older plugins were complaining about incompatibilities…​ This means the chance of getting a good image out of the pipeline starting with a DMA Buffer is very small. Given the state of things, we are currently copying the buffer through host-memory once to side-step this issue for now. The plan for the future is to provide first an experimental option for using DMA buffers, and later with more testing and development we will hopefully be able to share, compose and finally encode different buffer types with zero memory copied between the GPU and the CPU for truely the best possible latency.

In order to debug what’s exchanged it might be useful to checkout the RFC 6716 #section-3.1 which defines the Opus packet formats; from the specs: A well-formed Opus packet MUST contain at least one byte [R1]. This byte forms a table-of-contents (TOC) header that signals which of the various modes and configurations a given packet uses. It is composed of a configuration number, \"config\", a stereo flag, \"s\", and a frame count code, \"c\" Figure 3. The first byte of any Opus packet Encoded audio packets will be AES encrypted before being sent over the wire, key and IV are exchanged via HTTPS when calling the launch endpoint. These are the same key and IV used to also encrypt the Control stream. Uses Reed Solomon to encode the payload so that it can be checked on the receiving end for transmission errors (and possibly fix them). This operation will create extra parity blocks that will be sent in separate RTP packets.","title":"Audio stream via RTP","component":"wolf","version":"stable","name":"rtp-opus","url":"/wolf/stable/protocols/rtp-opus.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"PING","hash":"_ping","id":2},{"text":"RTP packets","hash":"_rtp_packets","id":3},{"text":"Opus encoder","hash":"_opus_encoder","id":4},{"text":"AES encryption","hash":"_aes_encryption","id":5},{"text":"Forward Error Correction (FEC)","hash":"_forward_error_correction_fec","id":6}]},"122":{"id":122,"text":"Here are a few random notes about the low level details of the video streaming protocol in Moonlight. The port exchanged during the RTSP phase it’s not where the actual video stream will take place! Moonlight will send a PING package to the exchanged port, this will tell us which random port the connecting client was able to open in order to communicate with Wolf. The client port from where Wolf receives the PING will also be the one where the actual RTP stream will be sent to. This is necessary because usually clients will be behind NAT. The video binary NAL unit (see below) will be separated in chunks of packetSize (default: 1024, exchanged during RTSP) + RTP_HEADER_SIZE (16 byte). The first 32 bytes of each packet are defined as follows: Figure 1. RTP header format in bits Figure 2.

Uses Reed Solomon to encode the payload so that it can be checked on the receiving end for transmission errors (and possibly fix them). This operation will create extra parity blocks that will be sent in separate RTP packets. The size of this can be set by changing the fecpercentage param. With a video payload of 4KB, a packetSize of 1024 and a fecpercentage of 50%: 4 RTP packets will contain the video data 2 extra RTP packets will be sent with the FEC parity information The total overhead of sending 4KB of video will be: headers * packets + FEC = 32 * 6 + 2048 = 2248 bytes This extra packets can be easily identified since the NV Video flag will always be 0.

RTSP messages are plaintext packets of variable size over TCP. Parsing of RTSP messages has been implemented using a formal PEG (Parsing Expression Grammars) definition; you can find it in parser.hpp. There are two types of message: request and response All messages have the following structure: message: required options: optional, zero or more key value options separated by newline payload: optional, extra unstructured data that needs to be passed. An example request message OPTIONS rtsp://192.168.1.100:48010 RTSP/1.0 (1) CSeq: 1 (2) X-GS-ClientVersion: 14 (3) (4) a=fmtp:97 surround-params=21101 (5) 1 message: 2 option 1 3 option 2 4 empty new line (end of options) 5 payload The message part is the first line, it’s delimited by the newline character (\\r\\n) , and it’s composed by: command: the first string, delimited by , the command to be executed on the backend; one of: [OPTIONS, DESCRIBE, SETUP, ANNOUNCE, PLAY] target: the second string, delimited by , specifies the ip address and port that is the target of the session. protocol: last string, delimited by , the RTSP protocol in use. Optional additional key values to be passed, delimited by the newline character (\\r\\n). The end of the options section is marked by an extra newline character (\\r\\n). Honorable mention goes to CSeq which is always present and represent the sequence number. Any extra unstructured text that it’s added after the end of the options before the end of the message will be parsed as the payload. Like requests, responses have a message, zero or more options and an optional payload. The main difference is in the format of the message. You can easily identify a response package by looking at the command part which is always RTSP. An example response message RTSP/1.0 200 OK (1) CSeq: 1 (2) a=fmtp:97 surround-params=21101 (3) 1 message 2 option 3 payload Unlike requests a message in a response is composed by different parts: protocol: it’s always RTSP/* and it’s the easiest way to discriminate between request and response messages. status code: follows the HTTP status codes specification status string: follows the HTTP status codes specification","title":"RTSP","component":"wolf","version":"stable","name":"rtsp","url":"/wolf/stable/protocols/rtsp.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"RTSP specifications","hash":"_rtsp_specifications","id":2},{"text":"Request message","hash":"_request_message","id":3},{"text":"Message","hash":"_message","id":4},{"text":"Options","hash":"_options","id":5},{"text":"Payload","hash":"_payload","id":6},{"text":"Response message","hash":"_response_message","id":7},{"text":"Message","hash":"_message_2","id":8}]},"124":{"id":124,"text":"Wolf is configured via a TOML config file and some additional optional ENV variables Variable Default Description WOLF_LOG_LEVEL INFO The log level to show, one of ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE WOLF_CFG_FILE /etc/wolf/cfg/config.toml Full path to the config file WOLF_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE /etc/wolf/cfg/key.pem Full path to the key.pem file WOLF_PRIVATE_CERT_FILE /etc/wolf/cfg/cert.pem Full path to the cert.pem file XDG_RUNTIME_DIR /tmp/sockets The full path where PulseAudio and video sockets will reside, this path is expected to be present in the host and mounted in the Wolf container WOLF_PULSE_IMAGE ghcr.io/games-on-whales/pulseaudio:master The name of the PulseAudio image to be started (when no connection is available) WOLF_STOP_CONTAINER_ON_EXIT TRUE Set to False in order to avoid force stop and removal of containers when the connection is closed WOLF_DOCKER_SOCKET /var/run/docker.sock The full path to the docker socket, doesn’t support tcp (yet) NVIDIA_DRIVER_VOLUME_NAME nvidia-driver-vol The name of the externally created Docker Volume that holds the Nvidia drivers HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER /etc/wolf The base folder in the host where the running apps will store permanent state WOLF_RENDER_NODE /dev/dri/renderD128 The default render node used for virtual desktops; see: Multiple GPUs WOLF_ENCODER_NODE $WOLF_RENDER_NODE The default render node used for the Gstreamer pipelines; see: Multiple GPUs WOLF_DOCKER_FAKE_UDEV_PATH $HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER/fake-udev The path on the host for the fake-udev CLI tool Additional env variables useful when debugging: Variable Default Description RUST_BACKTRACE full In case an exception is thrown in the Rust code, this sets the backtrace level GST_DEBUG 2 Gstreamer debug print, see debugging-tools Since Wolf supports multiple streaming sessions at the same time and each session can run a different app, we need to make sure that each app has its own folder where it can store permanent data. To achieve this, for each running app, Wolf will create a folder structure like this: ${HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER}/${app_state_folder}/${app_title} and then mount that as the home (/home/retro) for the docker container that will run the selected app. These 3 variables are defined as follows: HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER: defaults to /etc/wolf, can be changed via ENV app_state_folder: defaults to a unique identifier for each client so that every Moonlight session will have its own folder. Can be changed in the config.toml file app_title: the title of the app as defined in the config.toml file This will break isolation, if you want to connect with multiple clients at the same time you should not share the home folder. You can follow development of that feature here By default, Wolf will create a new home folder for each client, but if you want to share the same home folder with multiple clients, you can set the app_state_folder to the same value for each paired client; example: [[paired_clients]] app_state_folder = \"common\" # ../../../../bus/virtio/drivers/virtio_gpu (1) /sys/class/drm/renderD129/device/driver -> ../../../../bus/pci/drivers/nvidia (2) 1 This line will tell you that renderD128 is a virtual GPU 2 This line will tell you that renderD129 is a Nvidia GPU Wolf supports also overriding the render node in each single app defined in the config.toml config file by setting the render_node property; example: [apps.runner] type = \"docker\" name = \"WolfSteam\" image = \"ghcr.io/games-on-whales/steam:edge\" # More options here, removed for brevity... render_node = \"/dev/dri/renderD129\" The easy way to control this is to just edit the env variable WOLF_ENCODER_NODE (defaults to match WOLF_RENDER_NODE in order to use the same GPU for both), this will set the default render node used for the Gstreamer pipelines. The streaming video encoding pipeline is fully controlled by the config.toml file; here the order in which entries are listed is important because Wolf will just try each listed plugin; the first one that works is the one that will be used. If you have an Intel iGPU and a Nvidia card in the same host, and you would like to use QuickSync in order to do the encoding, you can either: Delete the nvcodec entries under gstreamer.video.hevc_encoders Cut the qsv entry and paste it above the nvcodec entry On top of that, each single apps entry support overriding the default streaming pipeline; for example: [[apps]] title = \"Test ball\" # More options here, removed for brevity... [apps.video] source = \"\"\" videotestsrc pattern=ball flip=true is-live=true ! video/x-raw, framerate={fps}/1 \\ \"\"\" In case you have two GPUs that will use the same encoder pipeline (example: an AMD iGPU and an AMD GPU card) you can override the video_params with the corresponding encoder plugin; see: gstreamer/issues/1167. This has been moved to the steam.adoc page. This guide demonstrates how to change the default keyboard layout and switch between multiple layouts in Docker containers. For Layout and Variant codes see: https://man.archlinux.org/man/xkeyboard-config.7#LAYOUTS Add environment variable XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT= and XKB_DEFAULT_VARIANT= to [apps.runner] config. Keyboard layout environment variable example [apps.runner] env = [ # ... \"XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT=fr\", \"XKB_DEFAULT_VARIANT=azerty\", ] Using configuration file allow more layouts to be configured. Note: configuration file is only supported for Sway compositor and won’t have any effect wih Gamescope. Create a config file at ${HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER}/cfg/90-custom.conf with the following content: input type:keyboard { xkb_layout \"fr,us\" xkb_numlock \"enable\" } xkb_layout : The first layout code you set will be the default layout. Add other layouts separated by commas. xkb_numlock \"enable\" turns on NumLock by default. In the same folder, edit ${HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER}/cfg/config.toml For each container where you want to use the custom layout, edit the \"mounts\" variable as follows: mounts = [ \"${HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER}/cfg/90-custom.conf:/etc/sway/config.d/90-custom.conf\", ] This ensures that the config is not overwritten. On the next app restart, the keyboard layout will be set to the default one specified. Start the console in Moonlight. Use the command: swaymsg input type:keyboard xkb_switch_layout next In Steam, add a \"Non-Steam Game\", and select anything as the target. Once the game is created in Steam, Right-click on it and select \"Properties\". In the \"Target\" field, enter: /bin/bash -c \"swaymsg input type:keyboard xkb_switch_layout next\" Rename the game to \"Switch Layout\". Close the properties window.

The downside of this method is that you have to manually re-create the Nvidia driver volume every time you update the drivers. Unfortunately, on Nvidia, things are a little bit more complex.. Make sure that your driver version is >= 530.30.02 First, let’s build an additional docker image that will contain the Nvidia driver files: curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/games-on-whales/gow/master/images/nvidia-driver/Dockerfile | docker build -t gow/nvidia-driver:latest -f - --build-arg NV_VERSION=$(cat /sys/module/nvidia/version) . This will create gow/nvidia-driver:latest locally. Unfortunately, docker doesn’t seem to support directly mounting images, but you can pre-polulate volumes by running: docker create --rm --mount source=nvidia-driver-vol,destination=/usr/nvidia gow/nvidia-driver:latest sh It will create a Docker container, populate nvidia-driver-vol with Nvidia driver if it wasn’t already done and remove the container. Check volume exists with: docker volume ls | grep nvidia-driver local nvidia-driver-vol One last final check: we have to make sure that the nvidia-drm module has been loaded and that the module is loaded with the flag modeset=1. sudo cat /sys/module/nvidia_drm/parameters/modeset Y I get N or the file is not present, how do I set the flag?

First, create a new file nvidia.conf in the /etc/modules-load.d/ directory and open it with a text editor. nano /etc/modules-load.d/nvidia.conf paste the following content to the file: nvidia nvidia_uvm For the changes to take effect, update the initramfs file with the following command: update-initramfs -u Add udev rules to add missing Nvidia devices nano /etc/udev/rules.d/70-nvidia.rules paste the following content to the file: # create necessary NVIDIA device files in /dev/* KERNEL==\"nvidia\", RUN+=\"/bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/nvidia-smi -L && /bin/chmod 0666 /dev/nvidia*'\" KERNEL==\"nvidia_uvm\", RUN+=\"/bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/nvidia-modprobe -c0 -u && /bin/chmod 0666 /dev/nvidia-uvm*'\" reboot you host and try running ls -l /dev/nvidia* again. Running Wolf in WSL2 hasn’t been properly tested. You can run Wolf in a very unprivileged setting without uinput/uhid, unfortunately this means that you’ll be restricted to only using mouse and keyboard. For Nvidia users, follow the Nvidia instructions above. This should work for AMD/Intel users. docker run \\ --name wolf \\ --network=host \\ -e XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/sockets \\ -v /tmp/sockets:/tmp/sockets:rw \\ -e HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER=/etc/wolf \\ -v /etc/wolf:/etc/wolf:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ --device /dev/dri/ \\ ghcr.io/games-on-whales/wolf:stable At the moment it is only possible to run Wolf inside a privileged LXC. First you need to make sure your GPU drivers are installed and loaded on your PVE host. Also make sure to add the virtual devices udev rules to the PVE host as explained in the Virtual devices support section. Now, we need to edit LXC config file to passtrough the GPU. I don’t have a LXC yet The easiest way to create an LXC to run Wolf is to use tteck’s PVE docker script, this will create you a LXC with docker already good to go. (Make sure you choose privileged LXC and install docker-compose when prompted) Enter the LXC config file: nano /etc/pve/lxc/1XX.conf it should look similar to this: arch: amd64 cores: 8 features: nesting=1 hostname: wolf memory: 8192 net0: name=eth0,bridge=vmbr0,hwaddr=BC:24:11:B7:90:5D,ip=dhcp,type=veth onboot: 1 ostype: debian rootfs: local-lvm:vm-118-disk-0,size=128G swap: 512 tags: proxmox-helper-scripts lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: a lxc.cap.drop: lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 188:* rwm lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 189:* rwm lxc.mount.entry: /dev/serial/by-id dev/serial/by-id none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyUSB0 dev/ttyUSB0 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyUSB1 dev/ttyUSB1 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyACM0 dev/ttyACM0 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyACM1 dev/ttyACM1 none bind,optional,create=file remove the following lines from the bottom, they are not needed: lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 188:* rwm lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 189:* rwm lxc.mount.entry: /dev/serial/by-id dev/serial/by-id none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyUSB0 dev/ttyUSB0 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyUSB1 dev/ttyUSB1 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyACM0 dev/ttyACM0 none bind,optional,create=file lxc.mount.entry: /dev/ttyACM1 dev/ttyACM1 none bind,optional,create=file add these lines to the bottom of the file: For Nvidia dev0: /dev/uinput dev1: /dev/uhid dev2: /dev/nvidia0 dev3: /dev/nvidiactl dev4: /dev/nvidia-modeset dev5: /dev/nvidia-uvm dev6: /dev/nvidia-uvm-tools dev7: /dev/nvidia-caps/nvidia-cap1 dev8: /dev/nvidia-caps/nvidia-cap2 lxc.mount.entry: /dev/dri dev/dri none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /dev/input dev/input none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /run/udev mnt/udev none bind,optional,create=dir For Intel/AMD dev0: /dev/uinput dev1: /dev/uhid lxc.mount.entry: /dev/dri dev/dri none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /dev/input dev/input none bind,optional,create=dir lxc.mount.entry: /run/udev mnt/udev none bind,optional,create=dir save the file, exit, and restart your LXC. Your LXC is good to go, complete the installation based on the GPU following the other tabs. When creating your docker-compose.yml don’t forget to modify the volume mapping for /run/udev path, as we mounted it on /mnt/udev inside our LXC volumes: - /mnt/udev:/run/udev:rw And if you have a multi GPU setup, don’t forget to set the below env variable environment: - WOLF_RENDER_NODE=/dev/dri/renderD12X Which ports are used by Wolf? To keep things simple the scripts above defaulted to network:host; that’s not really required, the minimum set of ports that needs to be exposed are: # HTTPS EXPOSE 47984/tcp # HTTP EXPOSE 47989/tcp # Control EXPOSE 47999/udp # RTSP EXPOSE 48010/tcp # Video (up to 10 users, you can open more ports if needed) EXPOSE 48100-48110/udp # Audio (up to 10 users, you can open more ports if needed) EXPOSE 48200-48210/udp You should now be able to point Moonlight to the IP address of the server and start the pairing process: In Moonlight, you’ll get a prompt for a PIN Wolf will log a line with a link to a page where you can input that PIN (ex: http://localhost:47989/pin/#337327E8A6FC0C66 make sure to replace localhost with your server IP) In Moonlight, you should now be able to see a list of the applications that are supported by Wolf If you can only see a black screen with a cursor in Moonlight it’s because the first time that you start an app Wolf will download the corresponding docker image + first time updates. Keep an eye on the logs from Wolf to get more details. We use uinput to create virtual devices (Mouse, Keyboard and Joypad), make sure that /dev/uinput is present in the host: ls -la /dev/uinput crw------- 1 root root 10, 223 Jan 17 09:08 /dev/uinput Add your user to group input sudo usermod -a -G input $USER Create udev rules under /etc/udev/rules.d/85-wolf-virtual-inputs.rules # Allows Wolf to acces /dev/uinput KERNEL==\"uinput\", SUBSYSTEM==\"misc\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", OPTIONS+=\"static_node=uinput\" # Allows Wolf to access /dev/uhid KERNEL==\"uhid\", TAG+=\"uaccess\" # Move virtual keyboard and mouse into a different seat SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{id/vendor}==\"ab00\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", ENV{ID_SEAT}=\"seat9\" # Joypads SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf X-Box One (virtual) pad\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf PS5 (virtual) pad\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf gamepad (virtual) motion sensors\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"Wolf Nintendo (virtual) pad\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\" What does that mean? KERNEL==\"uinput\", SUBSYSTEM==\"misc\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", OPTIONS+=\"static_node=uinput\" Allows Wolf to access /dev/uinput on your system. It needs that node to create the virtual devices. This is usually not the default on servers, but if that is already working for you on your desktop system, you can skip this line. SUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{id/vendor}==\"ab00\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", ENV{ID_SEAT}=\"seat9\" This line checks for the custom vendor-id that Wolf gives to newly created virtual devices and assigns them to seat9, which will cause any session with a lower seat (usually you only have seat1 for your main session) to ignore the devices.

The assigned name instead is specific to Wolf. You can’t assign controllers a seat however (well - you can - but it won’t have the same effect), so we just give it permissions where only user+group can pick it up.

If it’s the very first time that you are running an app, and you can only see a black screen with a cursor in Moonlight, it’s probably because Wolf is downloading the corresponding docker image and installing first time updates (when necessary). If this persists or Moonlight kicks you out of the streaming session then you should probably take a look at the Wolf logs to gather more informations. Example log line: vulkan: physical device 10de:1c03 compute queue doesn't support presenting on our surface, using graphics queue vulkan: selecting physical device 'NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB': queue family 0 vulkan: physical device supports DRM format modifiers vulkan: vkCreateDevice failed (VkResult: -7) Failed to initialize Vulkan Vulkan errors are generally related to the video drivers.

The easiest way is to follow the examples that already exist; one particularly good option is the RetroArch app that is bundled with GoW.

First you’ll need a Docker container for your app. It’s possible that one may already exist, but if not, creating one is pretty easy. Copy the images/retroarch directory and all of its contents to a new directory for your app; let’s call it images/myapp. Inside the configs directory, you can put default versions of any configuration files that may be needed by your app. If there aren’t any, you can simply delete the configs directory.

Here are a few specifics that you’ll definitely want to update: Be sure to update the REQUIRED_PACKAGES variable to include all of the packages your app will need to have installed when it’s running. You can use the add-apt-repository tool in your RUN command to add any extra package repositories you might need to install from. Be sure to change the line that installs the configuration file to install the files required by your app. In the compose/apps directory, copy retroarch.yml to myapp.yml.

GOW is a composition of Docker containers that enable users to stream graphical applications to Moonlight clients. We wrapped each individual piece of software with the necessary dependencies into its own Docker image and use docker-compose in order to manage the composition of all the necessary pieces. The streaming host is the heart of this system; it’s in charge of: Encoding the graphical environment (Xorg) and audio (PulseAudio) into a video that will be streamed to Moonlight clients This process can be hardware accelerated using VAAPI or CUDA depending on your GPU hardware Translating remote input devices into local input devices (eg: keyboards, mice, gamepads) This is achieved by using the uinput kernel module. Games on Whales currently has support for two streaming hosts: Sunshine (more mature, and the default), and Wolf (still in alpha, but very usable). These two components are in charge of Display and Audio, respectively. If your OS comes with a desktop environment already, you will most likely want to use that instead of trying to run it in a container. If you’re running a headless system you’ll need to run them in order to run graphical applications. You can use our Docker images for that. While PulseAudio runs just fine without a real sound device, for best results Xorg should be hardware accelerated using a GPU. That’s the main reason why we choose the full Xorg server over Xvfb. While it’s more complicated to run the full Xorg server, the benefits of having hardware acceleration are too great to be dismissed. Graphical applications can run easily on top of Xorg and PulseAudio — that’s how most desktop environments work! Sharing sockets between containers is the mechanism that enables us to have proper isolation. Instead of having a big single Docker image which installs and runs all the individual pieces of software together, we can decouple them and share only a communication channel. This means that it’s very simple to make a Docker container of any given GUI application and that same container will work both on GOW or on a normal Desktop Environment, enabling users to have a high degree of freedom on how to use them. A GPU is not required to run any of this, but it’s highly recommended for best results. Sharing a GPU across Docker containers is generally done by sharing the DRM devices (/dev/dri/cardX). This should work as long as your GPU supports VA-API. Notably, NVIDIA cards don’t; instead we provide specific instructions for them.","title":"Components Overview","component":"gow","version":"","name":"components-overview","url":"/gow/components-overview.html","titles":[{"text":"Streaming host","hash":"_streaming_host","id":1},{"text":"Xorg & PulseAudio","hash":"_xorg_pulseaudio","id":2},{"text":"GUIs","hash":"_guis","id":3},{"text":"GPU","hash":"_gpu","id":4}]},"130":{"id":130,"text":"Before launching GoW for the first time, you’ll want to set up your environment to your tastes. GoW is set up to use a directory of your choice from your host system as a place to store anything that needs to persist when you stop and restart containers. Because this same directory is (typically) mapped into each container, it can also be a way to share data between multiple containers. Before you launch GoW for the first time, create a new directory and update the LOCAL_STATE variable in your User environment to match. On unRAID, the local_state folder you just created will likely be owned by root, and it may not be writable from the containers launched by GoW, which mostly do not run as root. Until GoW has support for changing the UID inside the containers, you may need to chmod 777 local_state to make sure anyone can write to it. In order to make the time zone inside your container match your actual local time zone, you’ll need to update the TIME_ZONE variable in your User environment. If you’re not sure what to set it to, check out this list of tz database time zones. Your user environment is typically stored in the user.env file in the directory you cloned GoW into. It contains a simple list of environment variables, one per line. Comments and blank lines are allowed, but variable substitutions are not. If it’s more convenient to store your user environment outside the git directory, you can also put it in $HOME/.config/gow/user.env instead. If both files exist, the one in $HOME/.config will be preferred. Host Desktop Headless Configuration values that are specific to running with the host desktop can be found in the env/host-desktop.env file. You might need to tweak the socket locations or XORG_DISPLAY based on your system. Configuration values that are specific to running in headless mode can be found in the env/headless.env file. Most of those values will already be set correctly, but you may want to tweak the resolution, frame rate, and display port to suit your preferences.

You are right! No one should trust the internet! Our images are built and pushed using Github Actions. You can manually check if the images are being tampered with by doing the following: Head over to the Actions section on Github and open up the build that you want to check For each generated Docker image there’s a step called Image digest – this is the sha256 checksum of the image generated on Github Head over to the Docker hub and check that the sha256 checksum for the image and the sha256 checksum for the commit are the same as it’s displayed in Github Here’s an example from the commit 98e5080 The associated Github Action for the xorg image reports: xorg > sha256:6b8555260ed07c7ed466e0b821922a3cedf4ee27b9d6b8fea9d6aa2995b75f61 The image layer details on the Docker Hub reports: gameonwhales/xorg:sha-98e5080 Digest:sha256:6b8555260ed07c7ed466e0b821922a3cedf4ee27b9d6b8fea9d6aa2995b75f61 You sure can! Here’s what you’ll need to know. We have two images that are only used as the base for our other images; they aren’t ever launched by themselves and therefore they don’t appear in the compose files. Since they don’t appear in the compose files, docker compose can’t automatically build them. Instead, you must specify which images to use as environment variables, found in env/build.env. If you want to build the base images yourself too, that’s no problem. First build the base image: sudo DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t my-gow-base images/base Then the base-app image, passing the base image you just built as a build arg: sudo DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=my-gow-base -t my-gow-base-app images/base-app Lastly, edit env/build.env to specify your newly built images to be used for future compose builds: BUILD_BASE_IMAGE=my-gow-base BUILD_BASE_APP_IMAGE=my-gow-base-app You can, of course, choose any tags you like instead of my-gow-base and my-gow-base-app. Any of the app or system images described in the compose files can be easily built using the run-gow script. First, edit the appropriate compose YAML files and uncomment the build: section, to let docker compose know you want to build those images rather than pulling it from a registry. You may also want to comment out the image: lines to make sure there’s no confusion. Then, build the images you’ve chosen by running run-gow: sudo run-gow [options] build You should call run-gow with the same options you plan to run apps with; specifically, be sure to use the right combination of --gpu, --platform, --streamer, and --app.","title":"Docker builds","component":"gow","version":"","name":"docker-build","url":"/gow/docker-build.html","titles":[{"text":"Example","hash":"_example","id":1},{"text":"I don’t trust you, can’t I just build the images myself?","hash":"_i_dont_trust_you_cant_i_just_build_the_images_myself","id":2},{"text":"Base Images","hash":"_base_images","id":3},{"text":"App and System Images","hash":"_app_and_system_images","id":4}]},"134":{"id":134,"text":"One of the earliest use cases for Games on Whales was to be able to host retro video games on a central server running RetroArch and stream them to clients wherever they happened to be. Absolutely! Streaming games works very well, but GoW can do so much more! Out of the box, GoW provides a platform for running just about any graphical applications you like. In fact, despite the name, you can think of GoW as a low-latency remote desktop solution. Often the focus is on a single full-screen application, but this does not necessarily have to be the case. You should be able to run any Graphical Application on top of the basic combination of Xorg + PulseAudio + Sunshine. We supply the necessary configuration files for steam, retroarch, and firefox by default, but you can use them as templates to create your own. See Adding an App for more details. GoW is even often capable of running containers provided by third parties; as long as the container can accept a DISPLAY environment variable to specify the Xorg display, it can be made to work. For example, this Firefox container (andrewmackrodt/firefox-x11) is an open-source Dockerfile and image. It’s a great example of running a container which wasn’t built with GOW in mind. This container doesn’t need to be run any special privileges or network mode , because mouse and keyboard events are handled by Xorg and passing the X11 socket is enough to have display and inputs. This increases security for non trusted containers by restricting what’s accessible inside the container. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for gamepads; if your container requires gamepad support you’ll need to use privileged: true and network_mode: ${UDEVD_NETWORK} just like in the RetroArch example. This is required because the device files for the gamepad do not exist at the time the container is launched (they’re only created once a client connects) and so far the only way we’ve found for a running container to see a newly created device file is using the privileged setting.

Lutris refers to its self as a \"preservation platform\", and provides scripts for installing many pieces of software on Linux, from games to productivity software. The software you want to run may already have an entry on the Lutris website, in which case, you can either install the software from the Lutris UI directly or extend the image to create a bespoke image. On first run, the startup scripts for this image will configure Lutris to store game installation files and installation meta-data in the /var/lutris directory. By mounting a volume at this directory, multiple instances of the image will share videogame installations. Most applications will save user-specific data in the home directory, which remains exclusively visible to the individual user. Lutris is a desktop application that launches other windows, and as such, it requires a window manager to run; we recommend enabling Sway (set the env variable USE_SWAY=1). The following documents the file-format for images in GOW in general, as well as a couple of peculiar specific to the Lutris Image. The Lutris image consists of the following files; images +- lutris +- Dockerfile +- scripts | +- startup.sh | +- startup-10-create-dirs.sh +- configs +- lutris-system.yml +- lutris-lutris.yml At a basic level, all images based on the base image will feature a Dockerfile and startup.sh script. The Dockerfile will stage the startup.sh script at /opt/gow/startup.sh, overwriting the version provided by the base-app script. The Dockerfile will also copy all the assets for the container (usually to /opt/gow/), and install any additional dependencies. The startup.sh script will launch at the start of every container. It must first prepare the home directory, which will be empty on first-run, and then launch the application. The Lutris image also features a /opt/gow/startup.d directory. Scripts placed in this directory will be sourced by the startup.sh script prior to launching Lutris. startup-10-create-dirs.sh is copied by the Dockerfile to /opt/gow/startup.d. It configures Lutris to install games in /var/lutris/Games by default, and allow multiple instances of the Lutris container to share installation files. These instructions are applicable to any image based on the GoW base image, and are useful if you want to make changes to the image. When making changes to images upon which other images are based, it is naturally required to build all dependent images to propergate the changes. docker build -t gow/base images/base docker build -t gow/base-app --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=gow/base images/base-app docker build -t gow/lutris --build-arg BASE_APP_IMAGE=gow/base-app images/lutris Place the following in /etc/wolf/cfg/config.toml [[apps]] title = \"Lutris\" start_virtual_compositor = true [apps.runner] type = \"docker\" name = \"WolfLutris\" image = \"gow/lutris\" mounts = [\"lutris-games:/var/lutris/:rw\"] env = [\"RUN_SWAY=1\",\"GOW_REQUIRED_DEVICES=/dev/input/event* /dev/dri/* /dev/nvidia*\"] devices = [] ports = [] base_create_json = \"\"\" { \"HostConfig\": { \"IpcMode\": \"host\", \"CapAdd\": [\"NET_RAW\", \"MKNOD\", \"NET_ADMIN\", \"SYS_ADMIN\", \"SYS_NICE\"], \"Privileged\": false, \"DeviceCgroupRules\": [\"c 13:* rmw\", \"c 244:* rmw\"] } } \\ \"\"\" This configuration creates a docker named-volume called lutris-games and mounts it at /var/lutris. Since this is where the games will be installed, this may need a lot of storage space. By default, docker will store volumes in /var/lib/docker/volumes. In the above example, you can change lutris-games to any arbitrary path on the host you like, and the game data will be saved there instead. Lutris supports launching games directly, skipping its UI, by passing the correct command line arguments to the lutris binary. Lutris uses this feature to add launchers to menus and desktop shortcuts. We can use it to create a custom container image which uses Lutris' installation scripts, but features a single program. Consider the following structure: images +- lutris-app +- Dockerfile +- scripts +- startup-20-configure-lutris.sh The Dockerfile would copy startup-20-configure-lutris.sh to /opt/gow/startup.d/20-configure-lutris.sh, which in turn would be picked up by the Lutris image’s startup.sh script, and would adjust Lutris commandline args to run the application. Super Tux is a Linux native game which is distributed via AppImage. It also happens to have a Lutris install script. To create a Super Tux image based on the Lutris image, replicate the above structure with the following file contents; ARG BASE_APP_IMAGE FROM ${BASE_APP_IMAGE} COPY --chmod=777 scripts/startup-20-launch-supertux.sh /opt/gow/startup.d/20-launch-supertux.sh ARG IMAGE_SOURCE LABEL org.opencontainers.image.source $IMAGE_SOURCE #!/bin/bash -e source /opt/gow/bash-lib/utils.sh gow_log \"[start-launch-supertux] Begin\" if $LUTRIS -lo 2>/dev/null | grep \"supertux\" then gow_log \"[start-launch-supertux] Super Tux is already installed!

But when you run the image in wolf, you will find the game open by default in windowed mode. Also, because Super Tux runs from an Appimage in docker, it requires the APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN environment variable to be set. These things can be configured in Lutris, and we can achieve the changes we desire by providing a customised version of a Lutris installation script. All we need to do is add the customised script to the scripts directory, have the Dockerfile copy it into the image, and change the startup script to install from the provided script. images +- lutris-app +- Dockerfile +- scripts +- startup-20-configure-lutris.sh +- supertux-appimage.yaml This customised installation script sets APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN as an environment variable, and passes --fullscreen as a commandline argument. description: '' game_slug: supertux gogslug: '' humblestoreid: '' installer_slug: supertux-appimage name: SuperTux notes: 'Arch-based systems might need to install the following dependencies: \"physfs glew1.10 libcurl-gnutls\"' runner: linux script: files: - appimg: https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/releases/download/v0.6.3/SuperTux-v0.6.3.glibc2.29-x86_64.AppImage game: exe: SuperTux-v0.6.3.glibc2.29-x86_64.AppImage args: --fullscreen installer: - chmodx: appimg - move: dst: $GAMEDIR src: appimg system: env: APPIMAGELAUNCHER_DISABLE: true APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN: true slug: supertux-appimage steamid: null version: AppImage year: 2003 The startup script is mostly the same as the previous version, except the installation command now points to the custom install script. #!/bin/bash -e source /opt/gow/bash-lib/utils.sh gow_log \"[start-launch-supertux] Begin\" if $LUTRIS -lo 2>/dev/null | grep \"supertux\" then gow_log \"[start-launch-supertux] Super Tux is already installed!

There are a couple of ways to handle this situaion. Nothing more to say, really. If you have an actual monitor, and you can get it physically close to your server, you can just use that. The Xorg desktop will show on the monitor, though, which may be undesirable. You can get dummy plugs for HDMI and DisplayPort that pretend to be a monitor by returning built-in EDID data when plugged in. They’re relatively inexpensive, and they don’t take up much space, so this is a popular option. You can also unplug the dummy and plug in a monitor as needed, which may or may not be a benefit depending on your situation. By setting up some custom configuration, you can force Xorg to behave as though a monitor is plugged in even when nothing is. This sounds like a slam-dunk for \"best overall option\" but the configuration is significantly more complex than simply plugging in a dummy, so it’s not necessarily the best option for everyone. Below is a summary of the changes you’ll need to make. EDID data is how Xorg determines what resolutions and timings your monitor supports without having to be explicitly configured for it. In the headless case we’re setting up, that means that the EDID file you supply needs to declare support for whatever resolution you want to run at. The exact steps for creating an EDID file will vary wildly depending on your setup and goals, so it’s a bit beyond the scope of this guide. Having said that, here are some pointers. The EDID file can either be a .bin binary file containing the exact 256 bytes of EDID data, or it can be a .txt file where each byte is represented as 2 hexadecimal characters, with the bytes separated by spaces. For example, this file, which has support for several resolutions up to 1920x1080. If that file doesn’t meet your needs, you still have options. One possibility is to read in the EDID from a connected monitor and use that. Alternatively, you can try to generate your own file using a tool like edid-generator, but that’s not something we’ve tested before. Create a new file somewhere called xorg-screen.conf. In it, put this configuration: Section \"Screen\" Identifier \"Screen0\" Device \"Device0\" Monitor \"Monitor0\" DefaultDepth 24 Option \"AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration\" \"True\" Option \"UseDisplayDevice\" \"DP-0\" Option \"CustomEDID\" \"DP-0:/home/retro/edid.txt\" Option \"ConnectedMonitor\" \"DP-0\" SubSection \"Display\" Depth 24 EndSubSection EndSection Next, make sure Docker knows how to find your new configuration and EDID files. Add lines like these to the volumes section under xorg in your compose/headless.yml to mount them into the Xorg image. services: xorg: # ... volumes: # START ADDING HERE - /path/to/edid.txt:/home/retro/edid.txt:ro - /path/to/xorg-screen.conf:/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/01-xorg-screen.conf:ro # END ADDING HERE Last but not least, make sure the XORG_DISPLAY_PORT variable in env/headless.env is set to the same value as the UseDisplayDevice option in your xorg-screen.conf file. If you copied the snippet above, the correct value should be DP-0. Now you should be able to launch GOW as normal, without any monitor-related issues.","title":"Monitor requirements","component":"gow","version":"","name":"monitor","url":"/gow/monitor.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Wolf has now completely replaced the simple bash script present in this repo. Games on Whales (GOW) lets you stream games (and other graphical applications) running in Docker containers with hardware acceleration and low latency. The goal is to allow a server to stream games to clients the same way you play a video on YouTube. A server is not necessarily a gigantic beast of a machine; in fact, GoW will probably run on hardware you already have, such as a laptop or desktop computer, or even something smaller and compact like a Raspberry Pi (in theory). Generally, you should be able to pick any OS that supports Docker and start using GoW, but testing and development are focused on Linux-based systems. We bring together a few different components: Platform Most of the software in the Games on Whales system runs in Docker containers. Containers are software packages that are designed to make installation and configuration easy by providing a consistent platform everywhere the package is run. You can choose to run GoW in either Host Desktop mode, or Headless mode. In Headless mode, we run a few platform containers for you: Xorg: The famous windowing system for managing and displaying graphical applications (GUI) PulseAudio: A sound server that can manage audio coming from multiple sources (apps). In Host Desktop mode, we expect the host server to provide those pieces. Streaming Server GoW streams running apps to clients using NVIDIA’s GameStream protocol. We provide a choice of two open-source server implementations. Although NVIDIA has announced that they are ending support for GameStream in early 2023, these open-source implementations (and thus GoW itself) do not rely on any NVIDIA support or infrastructure and will continue to work even after that date. Sunshine: The original open-source GameStream host, and still the most well-tested. Use this if you’re unsure which one to pick. Wolf: A new GameStream host, still in alpha. Client Moonlight is an open-source GameStream protocol client. Moonlight runs on many platforms, including: mobile phones, laptops, desktops, Steam Deck, and even the Nintendo Switch! Moonlight is not distributed with GoW. You’ll need to install it on each device you plan to use as a client for playing games. Applications The GoW system aims to be compatible with as many GUI app containers as possible. Here’s a selection of the ones we provide, though adding more is a very straightforward process. RetroArch: An open source, cross-platform frontend for emulators, game engines, and more!

Wolf has now completely replaced the simple bash script present in this repo. Games on Whales ties together several different components, with support for many host OSes and hardware configurations. In order to make it easier to manage all that, and even make most of it automatic, we’ve provided a Bash script to handle the details for you. You can think of run-gow as a frontend for docker-compose; it takes some of its own arguments at the beginning, but passes everything else on untouched. The complete usage description is below, but first let’s talk about a few of the options you’re definitely going to want to set. The --platform option is used to specify whether the underlying Xorg and Pulse platform is provided by the host computer, or if GoW should launch containers for those components. Use --platform host to use the host’s platform, or --platform headless to launch the platform in containers. The default is --platform host. Some GPUs require extra configuration, so the --gpu option is available to tell run-gow which GPU you plan on using. Possible values are nvidia and intel. Notably, AMD GPUs are reported to be working well without any additional configuration, so you won’t need this option if you’re using AMD. If you’re running headless and you have more than one GPU, including if you have a dedicated GPU and an iGPU, you may need to manually tell Xorg which GPU to use. See here for details on how to do that. You should set the --gpu option appropriately for the GPU you plan to use. By default, if you launch GoW and connect with Moonlight, you’ll only see a basic desktop. However, it’s likely that you have at least one application in mind that you’d like to launch, and you can use the --app argument to specify that. Supported apps can be found in the compose/apps directory; just leave off the .yml: $ ./run-gow --app steam You can specify --app [app name] as many times as you like, if you want to launch multiple applications. run-gow Usage Launch the Games on Whales system Usage: run-gow [options] [compose commands] Arguments after the last option will be passed directly to 'docker compose'. For example, to launch the containers in the background, try: $ run-gow --app retroarch up -d Options: -h, --help Print this help text. -a, --app Specify an application to launch. Can be used multiple times. -d, --debug Print some extra debugging information before running Docker commands. -e, --env-file Specify an additional file of environment varibles to load before launching 'docker compose'. -g, --gpu Use this option to specify what type of GPU to use with Games on Whales. Not all GPU types require this option (notably, AMD does not). Possible types: nvidia, intel -p, --platform Use this option to specify whether system services like Xorg should be containerized or not. Possible values: headless - run xorg, udev, and pulse in containers host - use system services already running on the host server [default] -q, --quiet If set, this script will not produce any output of its own. This will not affect output from 'docker compose'. -s, --streamer Use this option to specify which streaming server should be used to connect with Moonlight. Possible values: sunshine - the original, more stable option [default] wolf - the bleeding edge option. still in beta. -x, --headless DEPRECATED. If set, has the same effect as '--platform headless' -- Signifies the end of options. Once you’ve got your system set up how you like it, you’ll find that many of the options you provide to run-gow won’t actually change very frequently, if at all. In order to cut down on the repetitiveness of always having to type those arguments every time you use run-gow, we’ve provided a mechanism to supply a set of \"default arguments\". You can do that by creating a file called $HOME/.config/gow/run-gow-rc that contains the defaults you’d like to use. The script will use the first non-empty, non-commented line as defaults each time you run, and any extra arugments you provide on the command line will override what’s in the run-gow-rc file. For example, if you set your run-gow-rc to this: --platform headless --gpu nvidia and run: $ ./run-gow --app steam up run-gow will launch Steam in headless mode with NVIDIA GPU.","title":"run-gow","component":"gow","version":"","name":"run-gow","url":"/gow/run-gow.html","titles":[{"text":"--platform","hash":"_platform","id":1},{"text":"--gpu","hash":"_gpu","id":2},{"text":"--app","hash":"_app","id":3},{"text":"run-gow-rc","hash":"_run_gow_rc","id":4}]},"146":{"id":146,"text":"Now that you’ve got your system set up, and GoW installed and configured, you’re ready to launch the system.

If the multilib drivers are not automatically installed on your host, please make sure you have installed both the 64-bit and the 32-bit drivers installed. Here are a few frequently asked questions related to Steam support; if you run into any other issues, feel free to file an issue on GitHub or reach out in Discord. You can look at Steam’s 'System Information' to verify that your GPU is detected. Many parts of the Steam client’s UI are rendered using an integrated webview, which can be sensitive to the size of /dev/shm. You can check the size in your container like this: $ docker exec -it gow-steam-1 df -h | grep shm If it is at least 500MB, you may be experiencing a different issue. Check the logs at local_state/.steam/debian-installation/error.log for more info on the specific issue. Surprisingly, you can!

In order to enable it: Steam > Settings - Steam Play [✓] Enable Steam Play for supported titles (optional) [✓] Enable Steam Play for all other titles There are a lot of different places for logs; for example, each game logs in a different folder. Here are a few hints on where to look local_state/.steam/debian-installation/error.log This is where most of the issues with the Steam client are logged local_state/.config/ This is where games usually put log and config files.

You can fix this by: sudo chown -R 1000:1000 local_state If keyboard and mouse are working it means that uinput, Xorg and Sunshine are correctly working. Gamepad devices are created by Sunshine on connection, only if the client has one attached.

So, if you’re looking to host GoW on a system that already has a desktop, and therefore a running Xorg server, it may be that your only option is to run in \"Host Desktop\" mode. In this mode, only the streaming server and the applications are containerized.
