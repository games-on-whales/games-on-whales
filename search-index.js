This gives us the power to support multiple concurrent users effortlessly. Code can easily be re-used by other projects since every part is highly decoupled. Enables testing most of the implemented methods in isolation. We are also trying to isolate the Moonlight protocol from the actual implementation so that we can create a portable C++ library of stateless methods, where possible, the code has been separated in logical modules. The crypto module depends on OpenSSL and provides an interface (crypto.hpp) to all the crypto related methods that are used by the other modules. Here are the methods that will deal with a Moonlight input event (ex: Keyboard, Mouse, Joypad). The code here will be platform specific with a default failover of noop. In Linux we used uinput and libevdev. Here we define core Moonlight functions in order to create the foundation for a platform-agnostic portable library.

The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing. — gstreamer.freedesktop.org We implemented two custom plugins (one for video and one for audio) in order to turn a stream of bytes into a stream of valid Moonlight RTP packets. This allows users to be able to compose Gstreamer pipelines in any form or shape and, near the end, plug our plugin so that it can be streamed to Moonlight. Figure 1. Our plugin sits between the encoded bitestream and a downstream UDP sink that will send the RTP packets to Moonlight The basic flow is the following: The plugin receives a GstBuffer of binary data: the encoded video or audio stream into a format that can be decoded back by the Moonlight client. We’ll split this into a GstBufferList of valid RTP packets following the Moonlight specifications; this includes: split the original buffer into a set of correctly sized chunks Encrypt the chunks when enabled add RTP headers to each chunk create additional RTP packets with the FEC information Push the resulting list downstream Figure 2. An example pipeline for video encoding and streaming Figure 3. An example pipeline for audio encoding and streaming This flow is general enough to enable us to use the same plugin for both H.264 and HEVC (and any other encoder that will be supported in future). Downstream, it’s also trivial to switch between UDP/TCP or even a complete different delivery method if needed. We decided to split between audio and video because they have different RTP packet structure, (non overlapping) properties, different FEC encoding and different encryption requirements but the basic flow is the same for both plugins. Given that this is a direct transformation from one input buffer to another output buffer we decided to use GstBaseTransform as the base class. This will implement some boilerplate code for us so that we can focus on the main _transform virtual method implementation. Following the nomenclature used in the official GStreamer RTP plugins we called them rtpmoonlightpay_video and rtpmoonlightpay_audio as in RTP Moonlight Payloader video/audio. GStreamer uses GObjects: a mechanism to retrofit Objects into C. I suggest you to get a bit familiar with it before diving into the code; here’s a great and simple tutorial. Following the official docs at Plugin Write’s Guide we started off with the official bash script that creates the boilerplate code from the selected base class; namely: gstrtpmoonlightpay_video.hpp and gstrtpmoonlightpay_video.cpp contain all the boilerplate code needed to setup a plugin, property definitions, etc. gstrtpmoonlightpay_audio.hpp and gstrtpmoonlightpay_audio.cpp for audio. video.hpp contains all the functions that turns a linear buffer of data into a list of correctly formed RTP packets. audio.hpp same for audio","title":"GStreamer","component":"wolf","version":"dev-wayland","name":"gstreamer","url":"/wolf/dev-wayland/dev/gstreamer.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"The plugin","hash":"_the_plugin","id":2},{"text":"Code","hash":"_code","id":3}]},"4":{"id":4,"text":"Gstreamer allows us to encode any video and stream it to Moonlight via our custom plugin, but we haven’t discussed the upstream video source. You can just use ximagesrc and hook your host X11 desktop to the stream but there are some issues with that: Xorg has to be up and running; we can run it via Docker in GOW but that’s not without its challenges. You need a physical monitor or a dummy plugged into your GPU (or some esoteric EDID trick which works only when also performing a human sacrifice). It doesn’t scale well with multiple remote clients when sharing a single host Ideally, can’t we just plug the shared video memory from the running App straight into Gstreamer ?? In theory, for a single fullscreen application that’s kind of possible (read until the end to get an idea of why it’s not so simple); but we need some way to compose multiple running windows into a single scene to be then encoded via the Gstreamer pipeline. Turns out that’s exactly what a Compositing window manager (or compositor) does, and since you can’t have just a compositor without the full X Window System (X11) running, we decided to follow the Wayland route. We are in a very fortunate position: we don’t even want to deal with real monitors, we just want to be the glue between an application running and the Gstreamer pipeline; for this reason we can have a simplified view (and implementation). Figure 1. A high level overview of the main components Let’s dive into each of these parts in isolation. The Wayland protocol does not include a rendering API. Instead, Wayland follows a direct rendering model, in which the client must render the window contents to a buffer shareable with the compositor. — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(protocol)#Rendering_model By removing the X server from the picture we also removed the mechanism by which X clients typically render, but there’s another mechanism: direct rendering. With direct rendering, the client and the server share a video memory buffer. The client links to a rendering library such as OpenGL that knows how to program the hardware and renders directly into the buffer. The compositor in turn can take the buffer and use it as a texture when it composites the desktop. One simple way to implement this buffer would be to use shm as a simple shared region between clients and the server. Most Wayland compositors do their rendering on the GPU, and many Wayland clients do their rendering on the GPU as well. With the shared memory approach, sending buffers from the client to the compositor in such cases is very inefficient, as the client has to read their data from the GPU to the CPU, then the compositor has to read it from the CPU back to the GPU to be rendered. The Linux DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) interface provides a means for us to export handles to GPU resources. Mesa, the predominant implementation of userspace Linux graphics drivers, implements a protocol that allows EGL users to transfer handles to their GPU buffers from the client to the compositor for rendering, without ever copying data to the GPU. Wayland is designed to update everything atomically, such that no frame is ever presented in an invalid or intermediate state. Our custom Wayland compositor knows where to get the rendered buffers, but it doesn’t know when the buffer is ready to be rendered; here’s where the Wayland protocol comes into play. Client surfaces will start in a pending state (and no state at all when first created), this state is negotiated over the course of any number of requests from clients and events from the server; when both sides agree that it’s a consistent surface, the surface is committed. Until this time, the compositor will continue to render the last consistent state. In Wayland, instead of continuously pushing new frames, you can let the compositor tell you when it’s ready for a new frame using frame callbacks. The compositor must finally compose the various surfaces into a single image, in order to do that efficiently we’ll also use EGL. Figure 2. The compositor communicates with the apps via the Wayland protocol, and compose surfaces via EGL Our compositor finally composed an image, and we are ready to send this to our Moonlight client, how do we push this to the selected encoder in the Gstreamer pipeline without copying? Sad news is, we don’t (at least currently). Although Gstreamer supports DMA Buffers (Direct Memory Access) which are an efficient way to share memory without going through the CPU, the support for modifiers of DMA Buffers is lacking behind significantly and varyies from one plugin to the next. What are modifiers? Modifiers add additional vendor specific properties to the internal pixel layout of a buffer. These modifiers are usually internally used by the GPU to speed up certain operations depending on characteristics of the hardware. None of this really has to worry us, because all of that is handled by the gpu driver. But because DMA buffers exist outside of the scope of a singular device, we need to carry the modifier of the buffer along. If it gets lost on the way, the program receiving the buffer has no idea how the data is layed out in memory and will likely output a broken image. Modifiers as such a crucial for communicating formats across devices, but they haven’t existed all the time. So called \"explicit\" modifiers are a relatively new addition to the apis in question. Previously the drivers managed modifiers internally without exposing them to the user. Buffers without an accompanying modifier are as such described as having an \"implicit\" modifier. Because the modifier is handled internally by the driver communication across devices is impossible with such a buffer. Because these changes are relatively new, a lot of software still has to adapt to the new explicit apis and many try to be able to handle both, implicit and explicit buffers. Gstreamer being composed of many plugins currently results in very different stages of transitioning between these apis. Some apis even got support for explicit modifiers, only to drop it a release later, because users of older plugins were complaining about incompatibilities…​ This means the chance of getting a good image out of the pipeline starting with a DMA Buffer is very small. Given the state of things, we are currently copying the buffer through host-memory once to side-step this issue for now. The plan for the future is to provide first an experimental option for using DMA buffers, and later with more testing and development we will hopefully be able to share, compose and finally encode different buffer types with zero memory copied between the GPU and the CPU for truely the best possible latency.

This involves quite a bit of cryptography and a few steps between the client (Moonlight) and the server (Wolf). Moonlight will send a salt and client certificate, users will see a prompt asking to insert the password on the remote server. On the backend, we’ll need the PIN to be inserted by the user. PIN and SALT will be used to derive a shared AES key that needs to be stored in order to be used to decrypt in the next phases. At this stage we only have to send back our public certificate (plaincert). Using the AES key that we generated in the phase 1 we have to decrypt the client challenge, We generate a SHA256 hash with the following: Decrypted challenge Server certificate signature Server secret: a randomly generated secret The hash + server_challenge will then be AES encrypted and sent as the challengeresponse Moonlight will send back a serverchallengeresp: an AES encrypted client hash, we have to send back the pairingsecret: using our private key we have to sign the certificate_signature + server_secret (generated in phase 2) We now have to use everything we exchanged before in order to verify and finally pair the clients.

An example request message OPTIONS rtsp://192.168.1.100:48010 RTSP/1.0 (1) CSeq: 1 (2) X-GS-ClientVersion: 14 (3) (4) a=fmtp:97 surround-params=21101 (5) 1 message: 2 option 1 3 option 2 4 empty new line (end of options) 5 payload The message part is the first line, it’s delimited by the newline character (\\r\\n) , and it’s composed by: command: the first string, delimited by , the command to be executed on the backend; one of: [OPTIONS, DESCRIBE, SETUP, ANNOUNCE, PLAY] target: the second string, delimited by , specifies the ip address and port that is the target of the session. protocol: last string, delimited by , the RTSP protocol in use. Optional additional key values to be passed, delimited by the newline character (\\r\\n). The end of the options section is marked by an extra newline character (\\r\\n). Honorable mention goes to CSeq which is always present and represent the sequence number. Any extra unstructured text that it’s added after the end of the options before the end of the message will be parsed as the payload. Like requests, responses have a message, zero or more options and an optional payload. The main difference is in the format of the message. You can easily identify a response package by looking at the command part which is always RTSP. An example response message RTSP/1.0 200 OK (1) CSeq: 1 (2) a=fmtp:97 surround-params=21101 (3) 1 message 2 option 3 payload Unlike requests a message in a response is composed by different parts: protocol: it’s always RTSP/* and it’s the easiest way to discriminate between request and response messages. status code: follows the HTTP status codes specification status string: follows the HTTP status codes specification","title":"RTSP","component":"wolf","version":"dev-wayland","name":"rtsp","url":"/wolf/dev-wayland/protocols/rtsp.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"RTSP specifications","hash":"_rtsp_specifications","id":2},{"text":"Request message","hash":"_request_message","id":3},{"text":"Message","hash":"_message","id":4},{"text":"Options","hash":"_options","id":5},{"text":"Payload","hash":"_payload","id":6},{"text":"Response message","hash":"_response_message","id":7},{"text":"Message","hash":"_message_2","id":8}]},"12":{"id":12,"text":"Wolf is configured via a TOML config file and some additional optional ENV variables LOG_LEVEL: controls the log level, defaults to INFO CFG_FILE: path to the TOML config file, defaults to config.toml GST_DEBUG: Gstreamer debug print, see debugging-tools.

We (try to) follow a functional programming paradigm where all the methods take immutable inputs and returns new outputs; this has great benefits: Given the highly parallel nature of Wolf, we can easily share immutable data structures to multiple threads without having to deal with race conditions. This gives us the power to support multiple concurrent users effortlessly. Code can easily be re-used by other projects since every part is highly decoupled. Enables testing most of the implemented methods in isolation. We are also trying to isolate the Moonlight protocol from the actual implementation so that we can create a portable C++ library of stateless methods, where possible, the code has been separated in logical modules. The crypto module depends on OpenSSL and provides an interface (crypto.hpp) to all the crypto related methods that are used by the other modules. Here are the methods that will deal with a Moonlight input event (ex: Keyboard, Mouse, Joypad). The code here will be platform specific with a default failover of noop.

You can read more about our implementation in the dedicated gstreamer page. The wolf module defines the glue code that wraps everything together into the final executable binary. It uses the following dependencies: Boost: mainly used for: logging, stacktrace, Asio (the basic building block of all network code in Wolf: HTTP/S, RTP, RTSP) cgutman/enet custom fork of lsalzman/enet used to run the Control stream over UDP. arximboldi/immer: persistent and immutable data structures; used mainly for data that needs to be shared across threads/logical modules.

The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing. — gstreamer.freedesktop.org We implemented two custom plugins (one for video and one for audio) in order to turn a stream of bytes into a stream of valid Moonlight RTP packets. This allows users to be able to compose Gstreamer pipelines in any form or shape and, near the end, plug our plugin so that it can be streamed to Moonlight. Figure 1. Our plugin sits between the encoded bitestream and a downstream UDP sink that will send the RTP packets to Moonlight The basic flow is the following: The plugin receives a GstBuffer of binary data: the encoded video or audio stream into a format that can be decoded back by the Moonlight client. We’ll split this into a GstBufferList of valid RTP packets following the Moonlight specifications; this includes: split the original buffer into a set of correctly sized chunks Encrypt the chunks when enabled add RTP headers to each chunk create additional RTP packets with the FEC information Push the resulting list downstream Figure 2. An example pipeline for video encoding and streaming Figure 3. An example pipeline for audio encoding and streaming This flow is general enough to enable us to use the same plugin for both H.264 and HEVC (and any other encoder that will be supported in future). Downstream, it’s also trivial to switch between UDP/TCP or even a complete different delivery method if needed. We decided to split between audio and video because they have different RTP packet structure, (non overlapping) properties, different FEC encoding and different encryption requirements but the basic flow is the same for both plugins. Given that this is a direct transformation from one input buffer to another output buffer we decided to use GstBaseTransform as the base class. This will implement some boilerplate code for us so that we can focus on the main _transform virtual method implementation. Following the nomenclature used in the official GStreamer RTP plugins we called them rtpmoonlightpay_video and rtpmoonlightpay_audio as in RTP Moonlight Payloader video/audio. GStreamer uses GObjects: a mechanism to retrofit Objects into C. I suggest you to get a bit familiar with it before diving into the code; here’s a great and simple tutorial. Following the official docs at Plugin Write’s Guide we started off with the official bash script that creates the boilerplate code from the selected base class; namely: gstrtpmoonlightpay_video.hpp and gstrtpmoonlightpay_video.cpp contain all the boilerplate code needed to setup a plugin, property definitions, etc. gstrtpmoonlightpay_audio.hpp and gstrtpmoonlightpay_audio.cpp for audio. video.hpp contains all the functions that turns a linear buffer of data into a list of correctly formed RTP packets. audio.hpp same for audio","title":"GStreamer","component":"wolf","version":"stable","name":"gstreamer","url":"/wolf/stable/dev/gstreamer.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"The plugin","hash":"_the_plugin","id":2},{"text":"Code","hash":"_code","id":3}]},"18":{"id":18,"text":"The control stream runs over UDP via a custom fork of ENET that supports IPV4 and IPV6.

PIN and SALT will be used to derive a shared AES key that needs to be stored in order to be used to decrypt in the next phases. At this stage we only have to send back our public certificate (plaincert).

RTSP messages are plaintext packets of variable size over TCP. Parsing of RTSP messages has been implemented using a formal PEG (Parsing Expression Grammars) definition; you can find it in parser.hpp. There are two types of message: request and response All messages have the following structure: message: required options: optional, zero or more key value options separated by newline payload: optional, extra unstructured data that needs to be passed. An example request message OPTIONS rtsp://192.168.1.100:48010 RTSP/1.0 (1) CSeq: 1 (2) X-GS-ClientVersion: 14 (3) (4) a=fmtp:97 surround-params=21101 (5) 1 message: 2 option 1 3 option 2 4 empty new line (end of options) 5 payload The message part is the first line, it’s delimited by the newline character (\\r\\n) , and it’s composed by: command: the first string, delimited by , the command to be executed on the backend; one of: [OPTIONS, DESCRIBE, SETUP, ANNOUNCE, PLAY] target: the second string, delimited by , specifies the ip address and port that is the target of the session. protocol: last string, delimited by , the RTSP protocol in use. Optional additional key values to be passed, delimited by the newline character (\\r\\n). The end of the options section is marked by an extra newline character (\\r\\n). Honorable mention goes to CSeq which is always present and represent the sequence number. Any extra unstructured text that it’s added after the end of the options before the end of the message will be parsed as the payload. Like requests, responses have a message, zero or more options and an optional payload. The main difference is in the format of the message. You can easily identify a response package by looking at the command part which is always RTSP. An example response message RTSP/1.0 200 OK (1) CSeq: 1 (2) a=fmtp:97 surround-params=21101 (3) 1 message 2 option 3 payload Unlike requests a message in a response is composed by different parts: protocol: it’s always RTSP/* and it’s the easiest way to discriminate between request and response messages. status code: follows the HTTP status codes specification status string: follows the HTTP status codes specification","title":"RTSP","component":"wolf","version":"stable","name":"rtsp","url":"/wolf/stable/protocols/rtsp.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"RTSP specifications","hash":"_rtsp_specifications","id":2},{"text":"Request message","hash":"_request_message","id":3},{"text":"Message","hash":"_message","id":4},{"text":"Options","hash":"_options","id":5},{"text":"Payload","hash":"_payload","id":6},{"text":"Response message","hash":"_response_message","id":7},{"text":"Message","hash":"_message_2","id":8}]},"25":{"id":25,"text":"Wolf is configured via a TOML config file and some additional optional ENV variables LOG_LEVEL: controls the log level, defaults to INFO CFG_FILE: path to the TOML config file, defaults to config.toml GST_DEBUG: Gstreamer debug print, see debugging-tools.

First you’ll need a Docker container for your app. It’s possible that one may already exist, but if not, creating one is pretty easy. Copy the images/retroarch directory and all of its contents to a new directory for your app; let’s call it images/myapp. Inside the configs directory, you can put default versions of any configuration files that may be needed by your app. If there aren’t any, you can simply delete the configs directory.

Here are a few specifics that you’ll definitely want to update: Be sure to update the REQUIRED_PACKAGES variable to include all of the packages your app will need to have installed when it’s running. You can use the add-apt-repository tool in your RUN command to add any extra package repositories you might need to install from. Be sure to change the line that installs the configuration file to install the files required by your app. In the compose/apps directory, copy retroarch.yml to myapp.yml.

GOW is a composition of Docker containers that enable users to stream graphical applications to Moonlight clients. We wrapped each individual piece of software with the necessary dependencies into its own Docker image and use docker-compose in order to manage the composition of all the necessary pieces. The streaming host is the heart of this system; it’s in charge of: Encoding the graphical environment (Xorg) and audio (PulseAudio) into a video that will be streamed to Moonlight clients This process can be hardware accelerated using VAAPI or CUDA depending on your GPU hardware Translating remote input devices into local input devices (eg: keyboards, mice, gamepads) This is achieved by using the uinput kernel module. Games on Whales currently has support for two streaming hosts: Sunshine (more mature, and the default), and Wolf (still in alpha, but very usable). These two components are in charge of Display and Audio, respectively. If your OS comes with a desktop environment already, you will most likely want to use that instead of trying to run it in a container. If you’re running a headless system you’ll need to run them in order to run graphical applications. You can use our Docker images for that. While PulseAudio runs just fine without a real sound device, for best results Xorg should be hardware accelerated using a GPU. That’s the main reason why we choose the full Xorg server over Xvfb. While it’s more complicated to run the full Xorg server, the benefits of having hardware acceleration are too great to be dismissed. Graphical applications can run easily on top of Xorg and PulseAudio — that’s how most desktop environments work! Sharing sockets between containers is the mechanism that enables us to have proper isolation. Instead of having a big single Docker image which installs and runs all the individual pieces of software together, we can decouple them and share only a communication channel. This means that it’s very simple to make a Docker container of any given GUI application and that same container will work both on GOW or on a normal Desktop Environment, enabling users to have a high degree of freedom on how to use them. A GPU is not required to run any of this, but it’s highly recommended for best results. Sharing a GPU across Docker containers is generally done by sharing the DRM devices (/dev/dri/cardX). This should work as long as your GPU supports VA-API. Notably, NVIDIA cards don’t; instead we provide specific instructions for them.","title":"Components Overview","component":"gow","version":"","name":"components-overview","url":"/gow/components-overview.html","titles":[{"text":"Streaming host","hash":"_streaming_host","id":1},{"text":"Xorg & PulseAudio","hash":"_xorg_pulseaudio","id":2},{"text":"GUIs","hash":"_guis","id":3},{"text":"GPU","hash":"_gpu","id":4}]},"30":{"id":30,"text":"Before launching GoW for the first time, you’ll want to set up your environment to your tastes. GoW is set up to use a directory of your choice from your host system as a place to store anything that needs to persist when you stop and restart containers. Because this same directory is (typically) mapped into each container, it can also be a way to share data between multiple containers. Before you launch GoW for the first time, create a new directory and update the local_state variable in your User environment to match. On unRAID, the local_state folder you just created will likely be owned by root, and it may not be writable from the containers launched by GoW, which mostly do not run as root. Until GoW has support for changing the UID inside the containers, you may need to chmod 777 local_state to make sure anyone can write to it. In order to make the time zone inside your container match your actual local time zone, you’ll need to update the TIME_ZONE variable in your [User environment]. If you’re not sure what to set it to, check out this list of tz database time zones. Your user environment is typically stored in the user.env file in the directory you cloned GoW into. It contains a simple list of environment variables, one per line. Comments and blank lines are allowed, but variable substitutions are not. If it’s more convenient to store your user environment outside the git directory, you can also put it in $HOME/.config/gow/user.env instead. If both files exist, the one in $HOME/.config will be preferred. Host Desktop Headless Configuration values that are specific to running with the host desktop can be found in the env/host-desktop.env file. You might need to tweak the socket locations or XORG_DISPLAY based on your system. Configuration values that are specific to running in headless mode can be found in the env/headless.env file.

You are right! No one should trust the internet! Our images are built and pushed using Github Actions. You can manually check if the images are being tampered with by doing the following: Head over to the Actions section on Github and open up the build that you want to check For each generated Docker image there’s a step called Image digest – this is the sha256 checksum of the image generated on Github Head over to the Docker hub and check that the sha256 checksum for the image and the sha256 checksum for the commit are the same as it’s displayed in Github Here’s an example from the commit 98e5080 The associated Github Action for the xorg image reports: xorg > sha256:6b8555260ed07c7ed466e0b821922a3cedf4ee27b9d6b8fea9d6aa2995b75f61 The image layer details on the Docker Hub reports: gameonwhales/xorg:sha-98e5080 Digest:sha256:6b8555260ed07c7ed466e0b821922a3cedf4ee27b9d6b8fea9d6aa2995b75f61 You sure can! Here’s what you’ll need to know. We have two images that are only used as the base for our other images; they aren’t ever launched by themselves and therefore they don’t appear in the compose files. Since they don’t appear in the compose files, docker compose can’t automatically build them. Instead, you must specify which images to use as environment variables, found in env/build.env. If you want to build the base images yourself too, that’s no problem. First build the base image: sudo DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t my-gow-base images/base Then the base-app image, passing the base image you just built as a build arg: sudo DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=my-gow-base -t my-gow-base-app images/base-app Lastly, edit env/build.env to specify your newly built images to be used for future compose builds: BUILD_BASE_IMAGE=my-gow-base BUILD_BASE_APP_IMAGE=my-gow-base-app You can, of course, choose any tags you like instead of my-gow-base and my-gow-base-app. Any of the app or system images described in the compose files can be easily built using the run-gow script. First, edit the appropriate compose YAML files and uncomment the build: section, to let docker compose know you want to build those images rather than pulling it from a registry. You may also want to comment out the image: lines to make sure there’s no confusion. Then, build the images you’ve chosen by running run-gow: sudo run-gow [options] build You should call run-gow with the same options you plan to run apps with; specifically, be sure to use the right combination of --gpu, --platform, --streamer, and --app.","title":"Docker builds","component":"gow","version":"","name":"docker-build","url":"/gow/docker-build.html","titles":[{"text":"Example","hash":"_example","id":1},{"text":"I don’t trust you, can’t I just build the images myself?","hash":"_i_dont_trust_you_cant_i_just_build_the_images_myself","id":2},{"text":"Base Images","hash":"_base_images","id":3},{"text":"App and System Images","hash":"_app_and_system_images","id":4}]},"34":{"id":34,"text":"One of the earliest use cases for Games on Whales was to be able to host retro video games on a central server running RetroArch and stream them to clients wherever they happened to be. Absolutely! Streaming games works very well, but GoW can do so much more! Out of the box, GoW provides a platform for running just about any graphical applications you like. In fact, despite the name, you can think of GoW as a low-latency remote desktop solution. Often the focus is on a single full-screen application, but this does not necessarily have to be the case. You should be able to run any Graphical Application on top of the basic combination of Xorg + PulseAudio + Sunshine. We supply the necessary configuration files for steam, retroarch, and firefox by default, but you can use them as templates to create your own. See Adding an App for more details. GoW is even often capable of running containers provided by third parties; as long as the container can accept a DISPLAY environment variable to specify the Xorg display, it can be made to work. For example, this Firefox container (andrewmackrodt/firefox-x11) is an open-source Dockerfile and image. It’s a great example of running a container which wasn’t built with GOW in mind. This container doesn’t need to be run any special privileges or network mode , because mouse and keyboard events are handled by Xorg and passing the X11 socket is enough to have display and inputs. This increases security for non trusted containers by restricting what’s accessible inside the container. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for gamepads; if your container requires gamepad support you’ll need to use privileged: true and network_mode: ${UDEVD_NETWORK} just like in the RetroArch example. This is required because the device files for the gamepad do not exist at the time the container is launched (they’re only created once a client connects) and so far the only way we’ve found for a running container to see a newly created device file is using the privileged setting.

There are a couple of ways to handle this situaion. Nothing more to say, really. If you have an actual monitor, and you can get it physically close to your server, you can just use that. The Xorg desktop will show on the monitor, though, which may be undesirable. You can get dummy plugs for HDMI and DisplayPort that pretend to be a monitor by returning built-in EDID data when plugged in. They’re relatively inexpensive, and they don’t take up much space, so this is a popular option. You can also unplug the dummy and plug in a monitor as needed, which may or may not be a benefit depending on your situation. By setting up some custom configuration, you can force Xorg to behave as though a monitor is plugged in even when nothing is. This sounds like a slam-dunk for \"best overall option\" but the configuration is significantly more complex than simply plugging in a dummy, so it’s not necessarily the best option for everyone. Below is a summary of the changes you’ll need to make. EDID data is how Xorg determines what resolutions and timings your monitor supports without having to be explicitly configured for it. In the headless case we’re setting up, that means that the EDID file you supply needs to declare support for whatever resolution you want to run at. The exact steps for creating an EDID file will vary wildly depending on your setup and goals, so it’s a bit beyond the scope of this guide. Having said that, here are some pointers. The EDID file can either be a .bin binary file containing the exact 256 bytes of EDID data, or it can be a .txt file where each byte is represented as 2 hexadecimal characters, with the bytes separated by spaces. For example, this file, which has support for several resolutions up to 1920x1080. If that file doesn’t meet your needs, you still have options. One possibility is to read in the EDID from a connected monitor and use that. Alternatively, you can try to generate your own file using a tool like edid-generator, but that’s not something we’ve tested before. Create a new file somewhere called xorg-screen.conf. In it, put this configuration: Section \"Screen\" Identifier \"Screen0\" Device \"Device0\" Monitor \"Monitor0\" DefaultDepth 24 Option \"AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration\" \"True\" Option \"UseDisplayDevice\" \"DP-0\" Option \"CustomEDID\" \"DP-0:/home/retro/edid.txt\" Option \"ConnectedMonitor\" \"DP-0\" SubSection \"Display\" Depth 24 EndSubSection EndSection Next, make sure Docker knows how to find your new configuration and EDID files. Add lines like these to the volumes section under xorg in your compose/headless.yml to mount them into the Xorg image. services: xorg: # ... volumes: # START ADDING HERE - /path/to/edid.txt:/home/retro/edid.txt:ro - /path/to/xorg-screen.conf:/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/01-xorg-screen.conf:ro # END ADDING HERE Last but not least, make sure the XORG_DISPLAY_PORT variable in env/headless.env is set to the same value as the UseDisplayDevice option in your xorg-screen.conf file. If you copied the snippet above, the correct value should be DP-0.

The goal is to allow a server to stream games to clients the same way you play a video on YouTube. A server is not necessarily a gigantic beast of a machine; in fact, GoW will probably run on hardware you already have, such as a laptop or desktop computer, or even something smaller and compact like a Raspberry Pi (in theory). Generally, you should be able to pick any OS that supports Docker and start using GoW, but testing and development are focused on Linux-based systems. We bring together a few different components: Platform Most of the software in the Games on Whales system runs in Docker containers. Containers are software packages that are designed to make installation and configuration easy by providing a consistent platform everywhere the package is run. You can choose to run GoW in either Host Desktop mode, or Headless mode. In Headless mode, we run a few platform containers for you: Xorg: The famous windowing system for managing and displaying graphical applications (GUI) PulseAudio: A sound server that can manage audio coming from multiple sources (apps). In Host Desktop mode, we expect the host server to provide those pieces. Streaming Server GoW streams running apps to clients using NVIDIA’s GameStream protocol. We provide a choice of two open-source server implementations. Although NVIDIA has announced that they are ending support for GameStream in early 2023, these open-source implementations (and thus GoW itself) do not rely on any NVIDIA support or infrastructure and will continue to work even after that date. Sunshine: The original open-source GameStream host, and still the most well-tested. Use this if you’re unsure which one to pick. Wolf: A new GameStream host, still in alpha. Client Moonlight is an open-source GameStream protocol client. Moonlight runs on many platforms, including: mobile phones, laptops, desktops, Steam Deck, and even the Nintendo Switch! Moonlight is not distributed with GoW. You’ll need to install it on each device you plan to use as a client for playing games. Applications The GoW system aims to be compatible with as many GUI app containers as possible. Here’s a selection of the ones we provide, though adding more is a very straightforward process.

In order to make it easier to manage all that, and even make most of it automatic, we’ve provided a Bash script to handle the details for you. You can think of run-gow as a frontend for docker-compose; it takes some of its own arguments at the beginning, but passes everything else on untouched. The complete usage description is below, but first let’s talk about a few of the options you’re definitely going to want to set. The --platform option is used to specify whether the underlying Xorg and Pulse platform is provided by the host computer, or if GoW should launch containers for those components. Use --platform host to use the host’s platform, or --platform headless to launch the platform in containers. The default is --platform host. Some GPUs require extra configuration, so the --gpu option is available to tell run-gow which GPU you plan on using. Possible values are nvidia and intel. Notably, AMD GPUs are reported to be working well without any additional configuration, so you won’t need this option if you’re using AMD. If you’re running headless and you have more than one GPU, including if you have a dedicated GPU and an iGPU, you may need to manually tell Xorg which GPU to use. See here for details on how to do that. You should set the --gpu option appropriately for the GPU you plan to use. By default, if you launch GoW and connect with Moonlight, you’ll only see a basic desktop. However, it’s likely that you have at least one application in mind that you’d like to launch, and you can use the --app argument to specify that. Supported apps can be found in the compose/apps directory; just leave off the .yml: $ ./run-gow --app steam You can specify --app [app name] as many times as you like, if you want to launch multiple applications. run-gow Usage Launch the Games on Whales system Usage: run-gow [options] [compose commands] Arguments after the last option will be passed directly to 'docker compose'. For example, to launch the containers in the background, try: $ run-gow --app retroarch up -d Options: -h, --help Print this help text. -a, --app Specify an application to launch. Can be used multiple times. -d, --debug Print some extra debugging information before running Docker commands. -e, --env-file Specify an additional file of environment varibles to load before launching 'docker compose'. -g, --gpu Use this option to specify what type of GPU to use with Games on Whales. Not all GPU types require this option (notably, AMD does not). Possible types: nvidia, intel -p, --platform Use this option to specify whether system services like Xorg should be containerized or not. Possible values: headless - run xorg, udev, and pulse in containers host - use system services already running on the host server [default] -q, --quiet If set, this script will not produce any output of its own. This will not affect output from 'docker compose'. -s, --streamer Use this option to specify which streaming server should be used to connect with Moonlight. Possible values: sunshine - the original, more stable option [default] wolf - the bleeding edge option. still in beta. -x, --headless DEPRECATED. If set, has the same effect as '--platform headless' -- Signifies the end of options. Once you’ve got your system set up how you like it, you’ll find that many of the options you provide to run-gow won’t actually change very frequently, if at all. In order to cut down on the repetitiveness of always having to type those arguments every time you use run-gow, we’ve provided a mechanism to supply a set of \"default arguments\". You can do that by creating a file called $HOME/.config/gow/run-gow-rc that contains the defaults you’d like to use. The script will use the first non-empty, non-commented line as defaults each time you run, and any extra arugments you provide on the command line will override what’s in the run-gow-rc file. For example, if you set your run-gow-rc to this: --platform headless --gpu nvidia and run: $ ./run-gow --app steam up run-gow will launch Steam in headless mode with NVIDIA GPU.","title":"run-gow","component":"gow","version":"","name":"run-gow","url":"/gow/run-gow.html","titles":[{"text":"--platform","hash":"_platform","id":1},{"text":"--gpu","hash":"_gpu","id":2},{"text":"--app","hash":"_app","id":3},{"text":"run-gow-rc","hash":"_run_gow_rc","id":4}]},"45":{"id":45,"text":"Now that you’ve got your system set up, and GoW installed and configured, you’re ready to launch the system.

Here are a few frequently asked questions related to Steam support; if you run into any other issues, feel free to file an issue on GitHub or reach out in Discord.
